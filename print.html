<p>The F-14 Tomcat can trace its origin back to the 1950's and the US Navy's need
for a carrier based long range interceptor to fill the Fleet Air Defence role.
It was decided that it needed an aircraft with a more advanced and longer ranged
radar as well as longer ranged air-to-air missile than the F-4 Phantom.</p>
<p>The Navy was directed, by then defense secretary Robert McNamara, to join the
Tactical Fighter Experimental or TFX program to procure this aircraft in a joint
venture with the US Air Force. The Navy was opposed to this from the beginning
and the proposed General Dynamics F-111B did not meet the Navy's expectations.</p>
<p>Grumman, which had been brought on board by General Dynamics for the Navy
F-111B, was eventually awarded a contract to begin development of an aircraft
more suited to the Navy's requirements. This led to the design that would
eventually become the F-14, carrying over the radar (AN/AWG-9) and missiles
(AIM-54 Phoenix) from the failed F-111B project.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat first flew on the 21st of December 1970 and entered service on
the 22nd of September 1974. The name "Tomcat" follows Grumman's tradition of
naming their aircraft after cats and also partially from the nickname "Tom's
Cat" for Vice Admiral Thomas F. Connolly who was instrumental for the
development of the F-14.</p>
<h2 id="service-life-upgrades"><a class="header" href="#service-life-upgrades">Service Life Upgrades</a></h2>
<p>The first version of the F-14, the F-14A was equipped with the Pratt &amp; Whitney
TF30 and carried an IRST system in the chinpod under the nose.</p>
<p>The TF30 engines were generally regarded as temperamental and underpowered for
the F-14A and were eventually replaced by the General Electric F110-400 engines
in the F-14A+ (later F-14B).</p>
<p>The IRST system was rather quickly determined to be underperforming and replaced
with the TCS (Television Camera Set) in the chinpod allowing for greater than
visual range identification of radar tracked targets.</p>
<p>Both the F-14A and F-14B received continuous upgrades during their life,
including new programmable cockpit displays (PTID and PMDIG) as well as a new
INS system, a digital flight control system (DFCS) and an RWR system amongst
others.</p>
<p>Eventually the Tactical Reconnaissance mission was also added to the F-14's
portfolio, enabled by the TARPS system, allowing the Tomcat to gather
photographic reconnaissance material.</p>
<h2 id="ground-attack-role"><a class="header" href="#ground-attack-role">Ground Attack Role</a></h2>
<p><img src="intro/../img/intro_bombcat.jpg" alt="Photo by LCDR Dave Parsons. (DN-SC-93-01299)" /> <em>Photo

<p>During the 1990's when the aerial threat to the fleets of the US Navy lessened
and with the advent of operations like Desert Storm, the ground attack role was
resurrected.</p>
<p>The ability to carry and deliver air-to-ground munitions had been implemented in
the F-14 from the beginning but ruled out by the Navy as cost and risk
ineffective given the F-14's role as a Fleet Air Defence fighter.</p>
<p>With the renewed interest for this role, some of the F-14As and F-14Bs were
equipped to carry the LANTIRN targeting pod allowing the RIO to find and
designate laser guided bombs for his own aircraft and others. Later on the
ability to carry and deliver gps-guided JDAMs was also added.</p>
<p>Most of the LANTIRN equipped aircraft were the ones upgraded with the
programmable TID or (PTID) allowing for greater integration of the LANTIRN.</p>
<h2 id="f-14d"><a class="header" href="#f-14d">F-14D</a></h2>
<p>In the 1990's the ultimate F-14 version was beginning to see service, the F-14D.</p>
<p>The F-14D used the same engines as the F-14B, the GE F110-400s in addition to
using the digital flight control system, which was eventually retrofitted into
operational F-14As and F-14Bs as well.</p>
<p>In addition the F-14D also had a newer, more advanced version of the AN/AWG-9,
the AN/APG-71, as well as a whole suite of upgraded avionics along with a new
chinpod combining the TCS with a new, improved IRST system.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-service"><a class="header" href="#end-of-service">End of Service</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat did eventually show its age, forcing the Navy to retire it due
to increased maintenance costs and the general status of the now dated
airframes. Additionally the Tomcat's primary role, the Fleet Air Defence role,
seemingly disappeared with the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The Tomcat was finally retired in a ceremony on the 22nd of September 2006 at
NAS Oceana.</p>

<p>The only other operator of the F-14 Tomcat was the Imperial Iranian Air Force,
later the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, for which the Shah of Iran,
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi acquired 80 Tomcats.</p>
<p>The eventual fall of the Shah and the rise of the Islamic Republic of Iran meant
that a country now opposed to the United States had access to one of its most
advanced fighter aircraft. This meant that the Iranian F-14s now lost access to
new spare parts and missiles, apart from black market sources, greatly
increasing the difficulty of maintaining the aircraft.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat was used during the Iran-Iraq war, claiming a great number of
air-to-air victories over the Iraqi Air Force, with some sources going so far as
to claim that Iraqi pilots at times left the contested air space to avoid facing
the AN/AWG-9 - AIM-54 combo.</p>
<p>To this date the IRIAF continues to fly the F-14 Tomcat as the sole operator.
It's not entirely known how the Iranians source their spare parts but it's
assumed that they've had to cannibalize inoperable aircraft to keep a portion of
their fleet flying. In addition rumours exist mentioning black market sources as
well as indigenous production of some parts.</p>
<p>The Iranian operated Tomcats are of the earlier F-14A revisions, using the TF30
engines and lacking a TCS or IRST system.</p>
<h2 id="aim-54-phoenix"><a class="header" href="#aim-54-phoenix">AIM-54 Phoenix</a></h2>
<p><img src="intro/../img/intro_phoenix.jpg" alt="U.S. Navy photo by Capt. Dana Potts. (020924-N-1955P-001)" />
<em>U.S. Navy photo by Capt. Dana Potts. (020924-N-1955P-001)</em></p>
<p>The AIM-54 long-range air-to-air missile was born from the same TFX program as
that which eventually led to the F-14 Tomcat.</p>
<p>It was designed for the F-111B and then adopted for the F-14 as a long-range
missile capable of long range engagement of enemy bombers in addition to hostile
cruise missiles. That's not to say that the AIM-54 Phoenix was a slouch at
engaging other smaller targets as well.</p>
<p>Outstanding features of the AIM-54 missiles were their long range as well as
their ability to be launched at up to six simultaneous targets, guided first by
the AN/AWG-9 radar in the launching aircraft and then its own active radar
seeker independently.</p>
<p>The original AIM-54 Phoenix was the AIM-54A with a mk47 rocket motor. The motor
was later on upgraded, creating the mk60 motor, increasing the missile's range.
Eventually the AIM-54 itself was also upgraded, resulting in the AIM-54C with,
amongst other things, an upgraded seeker head and a newer version of the mk47
producing less smoke, making the missile hard to spot visually.</p>
<p>The US Navy fired only three AIM-54 missiles in combat, all three over Iraq. The
missiles never hit their intended targets though as two of the missiles' rocket
motors failed with the third also missing its target as it turned tail and ran.</p>
<p>While little is known for certain in the western hemisphere, the IRIAF claims at
least 78 air-to-air victories using the AIM-54 against Iraqi MiG-21s, MiG-23s,
MiG-25s, Mirage F-1s, Super Etendards and even some anti-ship cruise missiles.</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The main throttle quadrant contains the two main-engine throttle controls, the
flap lever and manual wing-sweep handle in addition to the HOTAS controls on the
throttles themselves. The throttles have detents in the OFF, IDLE and MIL
positions.</p>
<p>Moving the throttles to the IDLE position from OFF arms the ignition and
disengages the fuel cutoff. The sideways movements of the throttles are not
spring loaded, this is so the pilot can have the throttle resting at MIL power
for catapult launches and prevents accidental spool down of the engines. A
friction lever for selection of desired throttle movement friction is located on
the left side of the throttle quadrant, beneath the flap lever.</p>
<p>The flap lever has a stepless range of motion between up and down and has two
emergency positions, one emergency up and one emergency down. Both emergency
positions have detents, the lever needs to be moved outboards to continue
movement into these positions. Emergency up forces the flaps up, overriding the
normal flap logic. Emergency down is non-functional.</p>
<p>The manual/emergency wing-sweep handle is protected by a guard and is normally
pushed in and stowed. The handle-top is extended for manual operation. For more
information see

<h2 id="hydraulic-hand-pump"><a class="header" href="#hydraulic-hand-pump">Hydraulic Hand Pump</a></h2>
<p>The hydraulic hand pump is located inboards of the throttle quadrant, near the

operation (with gear handle in the down position) or for refueling probe
operation in case of a failure in the hydraulic system.</p>

<p>The Central Air Data Computer or CADC is the computer acting as the spider in
the web for most aircraft flight sensors and relaying this information to all
systems needing them.</p>
<p>In addition, it also controls the wing-sweep via the wing-sweep schedule and
also controls the flaps and slats as they are limited by that same schedule.</p>

<p>The flight control system on the F-14 Tomcat is driven by the two main hydraulic
circuits, powered by pumps connected to each engine.</p>
<p>For longitudinal (pitch) control both tail stabilizers are deflected in unison,
acting in the same way as traditional elevators.</p>
<p>Lateral (roll) control is produced by both the tail stabilizers and the spoilers
working in unison. To produce roll the stabilizers are deflected opposite each
other to act as ailerons in combination with the spoilers on the side to which
roll is commanded.</p>
<p>The rudders on the F-14 is a standard rudder configuration albeit in a two tail,
two rudder configuration.</p>
<p>Control surface position is indicated on the Control Surface Position Indicator
and can also be used to check trim position with controls at neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Above 15 units AOA, the rudders should be used for lateral (roll) control
due to the different airflow along the aircraft control surfaces.</p>

<h2 id="trim"><a class="header" href="#trim">Trim</a></h2>
<p>Longitudinal and lateral trim is accomplished via the trim hat on the Control
Stick. This changes the stick neutral position, thus trimming the aircraft.
Rudder trim is accomplished via the <strong>RUDDER TRIM</strong> switch on the Inlet
Ramps/Throttle Control Panel, changing the neutral rudder position.</p>
<p>The Mach Trim and ITS (Integrated Trim System) automatically trims to compensate
for changes in longitudinal trim. The Mach Trim system compensates for transonic
and supersonic trim changes and the ITS for trim changes due to flap and
speed-brake position changes.</p>
<h2 id="afcs-automatic-flight-control-system"><a class="header" href="#afcs-automatic-flight-control-system">AFCS Automatic Flight Control System</a></h2>
<p>The AFCS or Automatic Flight Control System provides additional aircraft
stability (SAS or Stability Augmentation System) via automatic control surface
commands generated from AFCS sensors. The AFCS is controlled by switches on the
AFCS Control Panel and pitch, roll and yaw can each be set individually.</p>
<p>The pitch and roll switches are spring-loaded to off but normally held to on by
solenoids meaning that if the system is turned off or inoperable the switches
return to off. The yaw switch is purely mechanical.</p>
<p>Roll SAS should not be used for situations involving flight at AOA above 15
units and should therefore be set to off for combat maneuvers.</p>
<p>If the autopilot emergency disengage paddle on the control stick is held down
the pitch and roll channels will be set to off.</p>
<h2 id="autopilot"><a class="header" href="#autopilot">Autopilot</a></h2>
<p>Apart from stability augmentation the AFCS is also used to provide autopilot
functionality. To use the autopilot all three stabilization channels must be
enabled.</p>
<p>The controls for the autopilot system are situated on the AFCS Control Panel.</p>
<p>Autopilot modes available are attitude hold, heading hold, ground track,
altitude hold, vector/pcd (precision course direction) and acl (automatic
carrier landing).</p>
<p>By setting the autopilot <strong>ENGAGE</strong> switch to on the attitude hold is engaged,
maintaining current aircraft attitude. Limited to within 30° pitch and 60° roll
angles and the aircraft will be automatically moved within this range. Current
attitude can be changed with the control stick and will be held when the stick
is released.</p>
<p>The <strong>ENGAGE</strong> switch is also a prerequisite for all other autopilot modes.</p>
<p>The <strong>HDG</strong> position on the HDG switch enables heading hold, maneuver the
aircraft to desired heading and with a bank angle of less than 5° to set
heading.</p>
<p>The ground track mode is entered by setting the HDG switch to <strong>GT</strong>, wait for
the <strong>A/P REF</strong> warning light on the left side of the Vertical Display Indicator
(VDI) to illuminate and then press the nosewheel steering button on the control
stick. The <strong>A/P REF</strong> warning light will then turn off and the ground track
mode will be enabled, setting the autopilot to follow a ground track by
compensating for aircraft wind drift.</p>
<p>The altitude hold mode is set via the <strong>ALT</strong>, altitude, switch and like the
ground track mode the <strong>A/P REF</strong> warning light will illuminate until the
nosewheel steering button is depressed, enabling the mode.</p>
<p>The Data Link Vector - Precision Course Direction mode is used to allow a Link 4
controller to remotely control the aircraft. This is not modelled in DCS.</p>
<p>Finally the ACL or Automatic Carrier Landing mode is used to conduct automatic
carrier landings in conjunction with the Link 4 data link and the on-board radar
beacon. To enable the ACL, set the VEC/PCD switch to <strong>ACL</strong> which will cause
the <strong>A/P REF</strong> warning light to illuminate. When intercepting the ACL
glideslope and with the <strong>ACL READY</strong> and <strong>A/P CPLR</strong> warning lights
illuminated on the VDI, depress the nosewheel steering button on the control
stick. This engages the ACL and lets the data link control the aircraft. The
<strong>A/P REF</strong> warning light will turn off.</p>
<p>The ACL can be used in conjunction with the APC (see Throttle Controls) for a
fully automatic landing. The ACL can be disengaged via the <strong>PLM</strong> button on the
right throttle and the APC via the <strong>CAGE/SEAM</strong> button on the left throttle.</p>
<p>All the autopilot modes can be overridden by enough force on the control stick
or by depression of the autopilot emergency disengagement paddle, automatically
resetting all autopilot switches to off.</p>
<h2 id="spoilers"><a class="header" href="#spoilers">Spoilers</a></h2>
<p>The spoilers located on the upper surfaces of the wings are used to control roll
as detailed above under Flight Control System, for braking on the ground as part
of the Antiskid system and as a part of the DLC system (see next section).</p>
<p>The spoilers are only used forwards of 62° wing-sweep as further aft these
conflict with the fuselage.</p>
<p>In case of a spoiler malfunction the spoiler symmetry protection logic disables
all of the spoilers in the same section as the failed spoiler, either inboard or
outboard spoilers. If this occurs the <strong>SPOILERS</strong> caution light on the
Caution - Advisory Indicator illuminates.</p>
<p>To override this the switch corresponding to the relevant section on the Spoiler
Failure Override can be set to override by lifting the guard and setting the
switch to <strong>ORIDE</strong> and then depressing the <strong>MASTER RESET</strong> button on the Fuel
Management Panel.</p>
<p>Spoiler position can be seen on the Control Surface Position Indicator.</p>
<h2 id="dlc-direct-lift-control"><a class="header" href="#dlc-direct-lift-control">DLC Direct Lift Control</a></h2>
<p>The DLC or Direct Lift Control is used to control vertical glideslope position
without pitch control inputs or engine throttle commands. The DLC uses the two
inboard spoiler sections in conjunction with small corrections on the tail
stabilizers to control lift.</p>
<p>The DLC is engaged by depression of the DLC switch on the control stick with
flaps down and throttles less than <strong>MIL</strong>. This causes the inboard spoilers to
extend to half and enables the DLC &amp; maneuver flap command thumbwheel on the
control stick to control them. The DLC also requires the AFCS roll and pitch
channels, the inboard spoilers and the hydraulic systems to be operative as
well.</p>
<p>Rotation of the thumbwheel forwards extends the spoilers towards the max up
position, decreasing lift and adjusting glideslope position downward. Rotation
of the thumbwheel aft retracts the spoilers towards the flush position,
increasing lift and adjusting glideslope position upward.</p>
<p>Another depression of the DLC switch disengages the system.</p>
<h2 id="flaps-and-slats"><a class="header" href="#flaps-and-slats">Flaps and Slats</a></h2>
<p>The flaps and slats on the F-14 Tomcat can be used in two modes.</p>
<p>The normal flap and slat extension is controlled using the <strong>FLAP</strong> handle on
the Throttle Quadrant. The flaps can be set to anywhere between retracted and
fully extended where the flaps will extend to 35° and the slats to 17°. The
auxiliary flaps, the innermost section, only have two positions, retracted and
extended. They will extend fully when the <strong>FLAP</strong> handle is at more than 5°
extension.</p>
<p>If a fault exists preventing retraction of flaps the <strong>FLAP</strong> handle should be
moved to the <strong>UP</strong> position and then moved outboard and up to the <strong>EMER UP</strong>
position, overriding faulty interlocks.</p>
<p>The other mode is the maneuver flap system in which the CADC uses the flaps and
slats automatically to improve aircraft performance. In this mode the flaps
extends to 10° maximum and the slats to 7° maximum and the innermost flap
section is disabled.</p>
<p>While normally automatic the maneuver flap system can be manually controlled
using the DLC &amp; maneuver flap command thumbwheel on the control stick. Forward
thumbwheel rotation retracts the flaps and slats and aft thumbwheel rotation
extends them.</p>
<p>When sweeping the wings the flaps are limited by the wing-sweep position. Aft of
21° sweep the auxiliary (inboard flaps) are disabled up. Aft of 50° all flaps
are disabled up. The slats are not inhibited by wing-sweep.</p>
<p>Position of the flaps and slats are indicated on the Wheels-Flaps Position
Indicator.</p>
<p>The <strong>FLAP</strong> light on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator indicates a
malfunction in the flap system with flaps at non symmetrical positions. The
<strong>REDUCE SPEED</strong> warning light on the left side of the Vertical Display
Indicator (VDI) indicates flaps not retracted above 225 knots indicated
airspeed.</p>
<h2 id="speedbrakes"><a class="header" href="#speedbrakes">Speedbrakes</a></h2>
<p>The speedbrakes on the F-14 Tomcat consists of three sections on the tail
located between the engines and these are powered by the combined hydraulic
system.</p>
<p>The speedbrake controls are located on the right Throttle and can be set to
desired position depending on how long the switch is held to the extend
position. Retraction always fully retracts the speedbrakes.</p>
<p>To protect the speedbrakes they will start retracting above 400 knots and will
continue to do so with increasing airspeed, additionally selection of <strong>MIL</strong>
power or above automatically retracts them.</p>
<p>As the speedbrakes disturb airflow around the tail the fuel dump is disabled
with speedbrake extension as to not have the fuel hit the aircraft.</p>
<p>Position of the speedbrakes can be seen on the Wheels-Flaps Position Indicator.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wing-sweep-system"><a class="header" href="#wing-sweep-system">Wing-Sweep System</a></h1>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/general_wingsweep_sweepschedule.jpg" alt="sweep schedule" /></p>
<p>Wing-sweep schedule as function of Mach number and related flap interlocks.</p>
<p>The wing-sweep system controls the geometry of the F-14’s wings, allowing the
wings to move from a 20° to a 68° position in the air. While on the deck an
oversweep of 75° is also possible reducing the F-14’s wing span to 33 feet
(about 10 meters).</p>
<p>The wings are moved by hydro-mechanical screw-jack actuators which are
interconnected mechanically, making sure they’re synchronized. As long as both
main hydraulic systems are functioning the maximum wing-sweep change rate is
about 15°/s. This can be affected negatively by negative g or large amounts of
positive g.</p>
<p>In normal operation the CADC, Central Air Data Computer, controls the wing
position as a function of current Mach via the wing-sweep program, this is known
as the <strong>AUTO</strong> mode. The pilot can also select a wing position aft of the
wing-sweep program manually or choose the <strong>BOMB</strong> mode that sets the wings to
55° or further aft depending on the program. Simply put, the CADC wing-sweep
program determines the max forward position of the wings. All this is done
electrically via two independent channels (for redundancy) to the wing-sweep
actuators.</p>
<p>Currently commanded wing position, CADC program wing position and actual wing
position can be seen on the wing-sweep indicator next to the ACM panel.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-mode"><a class="header" href="#emergency-mode">Emergency Mode</a></h2>
<p>While the normal mode controls the wing-sweep electrically, to supplement this
it’s also possible to control the wing-sweep mechanically via the emergency
mode. This is done via the emergency wing-sweep handle on the right side of the
throttle. That handle is connected mechanically to the hydraulic valves in the
wing-sweep system, providing a physical back-up control.</p>
<p>Normally this handle is moved with the electronic wing-sweep program by a servo
located beneath it, making sure it’s at the actual wing position. To disengage
the electric system and enable the emergency mode the guard over the handle is
opened and then the handle is extended for additional leverage. Then the handle
can be forced out of the spider-detent normally connecting it to the electrical
servo and then used to manually set the wing position.</p>
<p>In this mode the pilot has to make sure to follow the following schedule to
avoid damage to the wings:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Speed (Indicated Mach)</th><th>Max Forward Wing Position</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0.4</td><td>20°</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.7</td><td>25°</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.8</td><td>50°</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.9</td><td>60°</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.0</td><td>68°</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>To return to the normal mode of operation, the handle should be pushed into the
desired position and pressed down and the guard closed. The <strong>MASTER RESET</strong>
button on the fuel management panel should then be depressed and the wing-sweep
system set to the same position as the handle. The servo will then drive to the
commanded position and re-engage the handle to the spider detent, resuming
normal operation.</p>
<h2 id="oversweep"><a class="header" href="#oversweep">Oversweep</a></h2>
<p>The emergency wing-sweep handle is also used to select the oversweep position of
the wings. The oversweep is only used while on the ground to reduce the wing
span to make it easier to spot the aircraft on the carrier deck. As the wing
will sweep over the stabilizers on the tail the horizontal tail authority system
is enabled to prevent the wings and stabilizers from damaging each other by
restricting movement of the stabilizer.</p>
<p>To set the wings to oversweep the emergency wing-sweep handle should be moved to
the 68° position and held in the extended position. This will deflate the
wing-seal airbags and activate the horizontal tail authority system, indicated
by the <strong>HZ TAIL AUTH</strong> caution light illuminating. When the <strong>HZ TAIL AUTH</strong>
caution light goes out and the <strong>OVER</strong> flag on the wing-sweep indicator appears
the oversweep interlocks are free and the handle can now be moved to the 75°
position and stowed.</p>
<p>To move the wings out of oversweep the handle is pulled up and moved forwards of
68°. This will again illuminate the <strong>HZ TAIL AUTH</strong> caution light. When the
wings have physically exited the oversweep the caution light and the <strong>OVER</strong>
flag will turn off.</p>
<p>As with normal emergency mode operation the handle should now be set to the same
position as the spider detent and the <strong>MASTER RESET</strong> button depressed.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-indicators">Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p>The controls for the wing-sweep system are on the right throttle (electrical)
and to the right of the right throttle (mechanical). See the Throttle and the
Throttle Quadrant.</p>
<p>The wing-sweep hat on the right throttle is normally set to <strong>AUTO</strong> enabling
CADC control of the wings, this is the upper position. The down position sets
the wing-sweep to the <strong>BOMB</strong> mode, 55° or aft.</p>
<p>The <strong>AFT</strong> and <strong>FWD</strong> (forward) positions enable manual movement aft of the
CADC scheduled position.</p>
<p>The emergency wing-sweep handle on the throttle quadrant is used to control the
mechanical emergency mode, see emergency mode above.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/general_wingsweep_wingsweep.jpg" alt="wing sweep" /></p>
<p>The wing-sweep indicator to the right of the ACM panel is used to indicate the
current wing-sweep positions. The pointer on the left side shows the CADC
scheduled wing position. The left tape shows the manually commanded position and
the right tape shows the actual wing position.</p>
<p>The five windows on the right side show:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OFF:</strong> System inoperable.</li>
<li><strong>AUTO:</strong> CADC controlling wing-sweep.</li>
<li><strong>MAN:</strong> Wings set manually with the control on the right throttle.</li>
<li><strong>EMER:</strong> Wings set with the emergency wing-sweep handle.</li>
<li><strong>OVER:</strong> Wings in oversweep.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant warning and advisory lights are located on the Vertical Display
Indicator (VDI) and the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator.</p>
<p>The <strong>WING SWEEP</strong> advisory light on the right side of the VDI illuminates when
both wing-sweep electrical channels are inoperable or the emergency mode is in
use. If it illuminates without the emergency mode being used that mode should
then be used as the electrical system might not work.</p>
<p>The <strong>WING SWEEP</strong> caution light on the pilot caution - advisory indicator
illuminates when at least one electrical wing-sweep channel is inoperable.</p>
<h2 id="wing-sweep-system-test"><a class="header" href="#wing-sweep-system-test">Wing-Sweep System Test</a></h2>
<p>The wing-sweep system can be tested on the ground in pre-flight without moving
the wings using the Master Test Panel.</p>
<p>To conduct the test, set the wing-sweep mode to <strong>AUTO</strong> and push the <strong>MASTER
RESET</strong> button. Set the <strong>MASTER TEST</strong> switch to <strong>WG SWP</strong>.</p>
<p>The CADC commanded position indicator on the wing-sweep indicator will now move
to 44°. The <strong>WING SWEEP</strong> and <strong>FLAP</strong> light will illuminate on the pilot
Caution - Advisory Indicator and the <strong>REDUCE SPEED</strong> warning light on the
Vertical Display Indicator (VDI).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The <strong>WING SWEEP</strong> advisory light will illuminate after 3 seconds into

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="landing-gear-system--ground-handling"><a class="header" href="#landing-gear-system--ground-handling">Landing Gear System &amp; Ground Handling</a></h1>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat has a tricycle landing gear designed to be fully retractable as
well as hardened enough to withstand the rigours of carrier traps. The landing
gear extension and retraction is powered by the combined hydraulic system as
well as having an emergency extension system. The emergency extension system has
a nitrogen bottle that can be used to power a one-shot emergency extension. With
the emergency system triggered, the system needs to be reset by technicians on
the ground to allow further normal retraction.</p>
<p>For additional information on controls and indicators see Landing Gear Control
Panel for controls and Wheels-Flaps Position Indicator for the indicators.</p>
<h2 id="nosewheel-steering"><a class="header" href="#nosewheel-steering">Nosewheel Steering</a></h2>
<p>The nosewheel steering system on the F-14 can be activated with weight on wheels
by depression of the nosewheel steering button on the Control Stick. The
activation of this system is indicated via the <strong>NWS ENGA</strong> caution light on the
left side of the HUD, see Wheels Warning/Brakes Warnings/ACLS/AP Caution/NWS
Engage Caution/Auto Throttle Caution Lights.</p>
<p>Disengagement of this system occurs automatically with weight off wheels
(take-off), electrical supply failure or lowering of the launch bar. It’s also
possible to deactivate the system by depression of the nosewheel steering
button.</p>
<p>The nosewheel, with the system engaged, is controlled via the rudder pedals.
It’s capable of a deflection of up to 70° meaning that it will turn tightly
enough that the inner wheel will in fact move backwards.</p>
<h2 id="wheelbrakes"><a class="header" href="#wheelbrakes">Wheelbrakes</a></h2>
<p>The wheelbrakes can be applied either via the rudder pedals by pressing on the
upper part of them, rotating them forwards. The other application is via the
parking brake handle located on the Landing Gear Control Panel panel.</p>
<p>The rudder pedals can be used to apply the brakes gradually while the parking
brakes are either on or off.</p>
<p>Normally both systems are supplied from the combined hydraulic system but if
that system becomes depressurized the brake system automatically switches to the
backup accumulators. The Emergency Brake Pressure Indicator shows current
pressure in the emergency accumulators.</p>
<p>If fully charged the auxiliary accumulator allows for about 13 to 14 wheelbrake
applications from the pedals and the parking brake accumulator 3 parking brake
applications minimum. These accumulators can be recharged via the Hydraulic Hand
Pump.</p>
<p>The <strong>BRAKES</strong> warning light on the left side of the HUD indicates either
parking brake applied, antiskid system fail or that the brakes are operating in
the emergency mode (only when the pedals are depressed).</p>
<h2 id="antiskid"><a class="header" href="#antiskid">Antiskid</a></h2>
<p>The antiskid system modulates the wheelbrakes to prevent skidding while on the
ground. When armed in the air the system prevents braking until both main wheels
are on the ground and the wheels have spun up. Also the system is not
operational below 15 knots.</p>
<p>The antiskid system switch also controls the spoiler brake system that deploys
the spoilers as brakes when the throttles are set to <strong>IDLE</strong> while on the
ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The antiskid should be disabled during taxi as below 15 knots, the system
may disturb normal braking even though the antiskid feature is not operational
at those speeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>ANTI SKID SPOILER BK</strong> switch on the Fuel Management Panel panel controls
the system. <strong>OFF</strong> disables the system, <strong>BOTH</strong> enables antiskid and the
spoiler brake system and <strong>SPOILER BK</strong> enables only the spoiler brake system.</p>
<h2 id="catapult-launch-and-arresting-gear"><a class="header" href="#catapult-launch-and-arresting-gear">Catapult Launch and Arresting Gear</a></h2>
<h3 id="nosegear-catapult-system"><a class="header" href="#nosegear-catapult-system">Nosegear Catapult System</a></h3>
<p>The nosegear of the F-14 contains the system allowing for catapult assisted
takeoff during carrier based operations.</p>
<p>The three components mounted in or on the nosegear are the nosewheel kneel
functionality, the launch bar and the holdback fitting.</p>
<p>To enable the system the aircraft is kneeled using the <strong>NOSE STRUT</strong> switch on
the Landing Gear Control Panel. This is done by holding the switch to the
<strong>KNEEL</strong> position until downward movement stops.</p>
<p>This drains hydraulic fluid from the shock absorber, compressing the nosegear
strut 14 inches. When compressed this also releases the lock on the launch bar
which can then be lowered manually by the deck crew or by turning the nosegear
more than 10° from center.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In DCS, the launch bar is automatically lowered with nosegear kneel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aircraft can then be guided onto the catapult and connected to the shuttle,
in DCS via default keybind <kbd>U</kbd>. The holdback bar is currently not
modelled in DCS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Deselection of nosewheel steering should be done before final movement onto
the shuttle and hookup to avoid misalignment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final command to launch the aircraft, after proper procedures, is then to
salute the “shooter” or officer in command of catapult launch, default keybind
<kbd>LShift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> in DCS.</p>
<p>After the catapult stroke, when the launch bar is released from the shuttle,
stored hydraulic energy is released to impart a positive pitch moment to the
aircraft. This also automatically raises the launch bar into its stowed
position.</p>
<p>Indication of the launch bar status is available on the Caution - Advisory
Indicator via the <strong>LAUNCH BAR</strong> advisory light. The advisory light is on with
weight on wheels when the launch bar is not up and locked and turns off if
throttles are advanced to <strong>MIL</strong> to enable a lights out for launch criteria.
With weight off wheels the <strong>LAUNCH BAR</strong> advisory light is on if the nose strut
hasn’t fully extended, launch bar is not up and locked or nosewheel hasn’t
centered correctly. This inhibits nosegear retraction.</p>
<p>The Launch Bar Abort Panel contains the LAUNCH BAR switch used to disengage the
launch bar in case of an aborted launch. This functionality is currently not
implemented in DCS, unhooking the launch bar is currently accomplished by
another depression of the hookup key, default key <kbd>U</kbd>.</p>
<h3 id="arresting-gear"><a class="header" href="#arresting-gear">Arresting Gear</a></h3>
<p>The arresting hook located on the underside of the tail of the F-14 is used for
arrested landings during carrier operations.</p>
<p>The system uses hydraulic power from both flight and combined hydraulic systems
and is controlled electrically, thus requiring electrical power as well.</p>
<p>Operation of the system is via the arresting <strong>HOOK</strong> handle on the Arresting
Hook Panel. <strong>UP</strong> raises the arresting hook and <strong>DN</strong>, down, lowers it to 37°
allowing it to catch the wire during a correctly executed carrier “trap”. The
transition light next to the arresting <strong>HOOK</strong> handle illuminates whenever the
arresting hook position does not correspond with handle position.</p>
<p>If on board failures do not allow for normal hook lowering it’s possible to use
a mechanical backup to deploy the hook. To activate the mechanical backup, pull
the handle out and rotate it 90° counterclockwise. This releases the mechanical
up-lock and drain the hydraulic pressure keeping the hook up, thus lowering it.</p>
<p>If electrical power and hydraulic power are restored, it’s then possible to
retract the hook by rotating the handle 90° clockwise and pushing the handle
back in and then setting it in the default <strong>UP</strong> position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Hook position also affects the AoA indexer and approach lights, making them
flash with gear down if the hook is not also down. This feature can be
disabled using the <strong>HOOK BYPASS</strong> switch on the Master Light Control Panel.</p>

<p>Depending on the variant, the F-14 Tomcat is either equipped with two Pratt &amp;
Whitney TF30-P-414A or two General Electrics F110-GE-400 turbofan
<a href="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/engines.html">engines</a>.</p>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/engines_overview.jpg" alt="Carrier Afterburner Takeoff" /></p>
<p>Each engine is fed by an independent <a href="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/fuel_system.html">fuel system</a> from fuel
tanks installed in the airframe.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="engines"><a class="header" href="#engines">Engines</a></h1>
<p>The F-14A is powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30-P-414A while the F-14B is
powered by two General Electrics F110-GE-400, both of which are afterburning
turbofan engines.</p>
<p>To provide the engines with an even subsonic airflow the F-14 has the AICS or
Air Inlet Control System. This system controls the variable geometry intakes by
moving the variable ramps mounted in them to slow the airflow. This is
accomplished using various sensor inputs run through a calculation using set
schedules which decides the positions of the ramps.</p>
<p>In addition, the TF30 uses two systems to improve reliable operation, the Mid
Compression Bypass System (MCB) and the Mach Lever.</p>
<p>The MCB helps mitigate high angle of attack airflow onto the compressor fans to
reduce the risk of an engine stall. This system vents air from the compressor
section to bypass duct to stabilize the airflow for later compressor stages.
Normally this system uses angle of attack and Mach number sensor data to
activate, but with the landing gear handle in the down position this it is only
activated with zone 5 afterburner. Additionally the WCS commands the MCB to
activate with extension of the refuelling probe as well as when launching AIM-7
or AIM-9 missiles, air to ground rockets or firing the M61 Vulcan gun.</p>
<p>The Mach Lever also mitigates the risk of an engine stall by controlling min and
max rpm allowed as a function of Mach number. In addition it also increases the
minimum rpm in high angle of attack regimes while subsonic.</p>
<p>The two F110s in F-14B, on the other hand, are controlled by the AFTC (Augmenter
Fan Temperature Control unit). The AFTC is an early engine control computer akin
to an early version of a FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) used on
newer turbine engines. This system controls both the engine itself as well as
the variable exhaust nozzles controlling the engine exhaust gases and removes
the need for the MCB and Mach Lever for the F110. The lack of such a system in
the F-14A controlling its TF30s is one of the reasons for them being deemed less
reliable than the F110s.</p>
<p>In case of a failure in the AFTC the MEC (Main engine control) is capable of
assuming control of the engines to provide a fall-back, mechanical control. The
normal mode, AFTC, is the primary mode (PRI) and called as such while the
fall-back MEC is the secondary (SEC) mode. The selection of primary or secondary
is automatic in case of a failure in the AFTC but can also be manually selected.
Of note is that in secondary mode the engine nozzles are fully closed and
disabled in addition to the afterburners being disabled with a corresponding
loss of engine performance.</p>
<p>In addition both engines also drive separate fuel, hydraulic and electric
generators to create redundancy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The main difference between the TF30 and F110 engines (apart from lesser
thrust in the TF30s) is that the TF30s are more sensitive to the quality of
the airflow entering the compressor face. In general it is wise to avoid
anything less than military power or afterburner while in high angle of attack
maneuvers as well as avoiding large rudder inputs or asymmetric engine
throttle settings. That said, the TF30s in the HB F-14A module have been
extensively tuned using available data and SME expertise, resulting in an
accurate modelling of an engine undeserving of its bad reputation. One
“advantage” of the TF30’s mechanical fuel control is its high speed thrust,
resulting in higher top speeds than the F110 can achieve. If flown within
normal parameters, the TF30 engines behave well if a tad underpowered compared
to the F110s.</p>

<h2 id="throttle-controls"><a class="header" href="#throttle-controls">Throttle Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/general_engine_throttles-schem.jpg" alt="throttles" /></p>
<p>The throttles in the F-14 have detents preventing unintentional engine start and
shutdown and unintentional selection of afterburner. In addition the throttles
also controls several different systems depending on throttle position as shown
in the diagram above. The most critical of these being the fuel cutoff and
ignition systems in the respective engines.</p>
<p>For throttle operations there are three modes:</p>
<p>The manual mode is a mechanical mode in which the engines are controlled by
mechanical linkages directly from the throttles to the engines. The manual mode
is designed as a backup mode and may be inexact because of the mechanical nature
of the controls.</p>
<p>Boost mode is the normal mode of operation in which electrical paths control
actuators moving the same engine controls as the mechanical linkages but more
exactly and with lesser force required.</p>
<p>The third mode is the approach power compensator mode or the auto throttle mode
which is a system which allows for automatic throttle control for optimal
angle-of-attack during approaches.</p>
<p>The controls for the throttle mode are located on the inlet ramps/throttle
control panel to the side of the main throttles and allows for selection of all
three modes. The auto throttle mode is solenoid held and will revert to boost
mode if the criteria for automatic controls are not met.</p>
<p>To allow selection of auto mode the throttles need to be between 75 to 90% rpm,
the gear handle needs to be down and with no weight on the wheels. If these
criteria are no longer met, the throttles are manually overridden with force or
the Cage/SEAM button on the left throttle is depressed the solenoid releases the
switch and it reverts to boost.</p>
<p>For additional auto-throttle tune the gain of the system can be set on the inlet
ramps/throttle control panel. The settings are hot, normal or cold with hot
increasing the throttle gain (and effective thrust) and cold decreasing it.
These settings correspond to cold or hot external temperatures but should be set
according to observed throttle control.</p>
<p>The RATS or reduced arrestment thrust system is a system limiting engine thrust
after touchdown to limit it to levels appropriate for carrier environments. The
system is enabled by weight on either main landing gear and is disabled by
selection of afterburner on the throttles.</p>
<p>Finally, and implemented only for the F110-GE-400, is the asymmetric limiter,
preventing asymmetric afterburner engagement if only one afterburner lights by
keeping that afterburner at minimum afterburner thrust until the other
afterburner also lights.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="navigation--communication"><a class="header" href="#navigation--communication">Navigation &amp; Communication</a></h1>
<p>The F-14’s primary navigation system is a multi-unit Carrier Aircraft Inertial
Navigation System (CAINS) designated as AN/ASN-92. An INS system measures and
integrates sensed inertia forces (acceleration) and rotational velocities to
calculate aircraft position and linear velocity. A good navigation system can
precisely guide an aircraft on a route to a mission objective hundred or
thousand miles-long, and then back to the home base, safely and reliably. Such a
system is even more important when an aircraft is designed to operate over the
ocean, far away from any ground-based TACAN or visual references.</p>
<p>Designing an INS (IMU) is an engineering challenge, which requires consideration
of such problems as calibration, alignment, Earth’s rotational motion, inertia
forces, thermal stability, analogue-digital converters precision, all different
types of corrections which have to be applied to keep the device precise over
extended time, and many more. Simulating an INS platform is very similar - it is
a complex undertaking.</p>
<p>At Heatblur, we decided to develop an entirely new mathematical model to
simulate the AN/ASN-92 for our F-14. We included all the potential sources of
errors contributing to the final precision of the device, and recreated the
characteristic behavior of a gimballed INS platform. The result is a set of
algorithms providing an authentic representation of the AN/ASN-92 in DCS, yet
optimized to have almost no impact on CPU performance.</p>
<p>The main components of the INS are the inertial measurement unit (IMU), the
power supply unit and pilot and RIO navigation controls and displays.</p>
<p>Although from the crew member’s point of view, the INS is used mostly for
navigation, it is also essential for proper operations of other aircraft
equipment. For example, the attitude is necessary for the radar. The attitude
and the own position are required for some weapon delivery modes, particularly
for long shots. Even more distressing to the crew, a complete failure of the INS
renders the more advanced modes of weapons such as the AIM-7 and AIM-54 missiles
inoperable.</p>
<p>The same information is used for data-link operations - when using erroneous INS
data, own tracks and targets received from cooperating aircraft will not match
and result in false contacts being displayed on the TID. These are only a few
examples, and the INS data is used whenever aircraft position or attitude is
required.</p>
<p>Thus the inertial navigation system (INS) integrates with the AWG-9 computer
(WCS computer) and the CSDC, the computer signal data converter. Other related
equipment includes the attitude and heading reference system, central air data
computer, radar altimeter, instrument landing system, and TACAN.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="navigation-system"><a class="header" href="#navigation-system">Navigation System</a></h1>
<h2 id="wcs-computer"><a class="header" href="#wcs-computer">WCS Computer</a></h2>
<p>The WCS or weapon control system computer and CSDC use several alignment
routines stored on a magnetic tape to perform the necessary computations to
align the INS.</p>
<p>These stored alignment routines in the WCS computer are called SMAL single mode
alignment program. When alignment is initiated, the routines are loaded in the
computer’s destructive readout memory from magnetic tape.</p>
<p>This process is called “tape read-in” and is represented by an M on the TID.
During the alignment of the IMU platform, the WCS communicates with the CSDC to
address specific CSDC navigation routines.</p>
<h2 id="imu-platform-alignment"><a class="header" href="#imu-platform-alignment">IMU Platform Alignment</a></h2>
<p>When alignment mode is selected, the IMU platform first erects to a coarse
alignment with the help of accelerometer output and gives an aircraft heading
that represents the angular displacement from true north. This displacement is
referred to as wander angle. The CSDC sends inertial velocity data to the WCS
during the alignment process.</p>
<p>The second stage – fine alignment – uses the precise measurement of gyroscope
drift to calculate the aircraft’s true heading. This is possible because of the
Earth’s rotation. At no point of alignment, is the magnetic heading used, and
the whole process relies only on the sensing of the non-inertial movement of the
platform within the 3d space.</p>
<p>The WCS calculates terms for platform alignment corrections and estimates the
value of the wander angle, it then sends this data to the CSDC. The CSDC uses
these correction terms in the CSDC inertial equations to generate pulses for the
platform torquing that are then transmitted to the IMU. The CSDC in return
receives velocity information from the IMU and sends this new inertial velocity
data to the WCS alignment program, upon which the cycle repeats. The exchange of
data continues until INS is entered.</p>
<p>The leveling process of the platform is achieved by the CSDC generating torquing
pulses based on IMU accelerometer off-level indications being sent to the IMU by
the CSDC. With each data exchange, the WCS calculates an error value (delta)
between the values of the previous and current wander angle. This delta is
largest at the beginning of the alignment and smallest at the end of alignment.</p>
<p>The alignment is finished when the delta is near zero and near zero velocity is
sensed along the platform X and Y axes. Variable factors required to align the
platform are continuously calculated, updated, and saved as calibration data.
When the alignment is complete, the system is ready to enter INS. The last used
calibration data and wander angle are stored in the CSDC upon entry into INS.
When in INS, the WCS accepts the velocity and position data and the wander angle
from the CSDC.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-modes"><a class="header" href="#navigation-modes">Navigation Modes</a></h2>
<p>Three navigation data mode sources are used for general navigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>INS</strong> - The primary navigation mode set by the RIO once IMU alignment is
complete. The IMU is the primary sensor supplying velocity data that is used
to compute all inertial outputs. The IMU is the source for roll and pitch
data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IMU/AM</strong> - A backup mode that can either be selected by the RIO or is
automatically entered when the CSDC determines the IMU inertial velocity data
is unreliable. In this mode, true airspeed from the CADC and stored or
entered winds are combined to provide ground speed and true heading for
general navigation. The IMU is the source for pitch and roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AHRS/AM</strong> - An even further degraded mode that can be either selected by
the RIO or automatically entered when the CSDC detects a total INS failure.
Heading in this mode is derived from magnetic heading plus entered or stored
magnetic variation (MAG VAR). This heading, TAS from the CADC, and entered or
stored wind are used for general navigation. The AHRS is the source of pitch
and roll.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="navigation-computations"><a class="header" href="#navigation-computations">Navigation Computations</a></h2>
<p>The CSDC and the WCS are aware of the selected navigation mode. The CSDC sends
the WCS navigation data parameters (TAS from the CADC, latitude and longitude,
inertial velocities, true heading, etc.) required to support general navigation
calculations. The WCS uses stored and input navigation data (based on the
current navigation mode) to perform the required navigational computations. The
WCS also performs additional computations so that the crew is provided with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current latitude and longitude</li>
<li>Attitude</li>
<li>Heading true and magnetic</li>

<p>Navigation information is displayed on the TID, HSD, multiple display indicator
(MDI), HUD, and VDI, depending on the mode selected by the pilot and RIO. If an
IMU or navigation computer failure occurs, two backup modes are available: IMU
airmass (IMU/AM) or AHRS airmass (AHRS/AM).</p>
<h3 id="navigational-controls"><a class="header" href="#navigational-controls">Navigational Controls</a></h3>
<p>To control the INS, use the navigation control and data readout panel and the
computer address panel. See Tactical Information Display (TID) and Associated
Controls and Associated Controls and Computer Address Panel (CAP) for a more
detailed description.</p>
<p>The desired operation mode, alignment mode, and destination point can be
selected at the navigation control and data readout panel. The CAP allows
entering navigation data and the selected information to be displayed on the
TID. The CATEGORY switch on the lower end of the panel determines the function
of the MESSAGE button. The categories used for navigation are NAV and TAC DATA.
The STBY and READY advisory lights on the navigation control and data readout
panel indicate the status of the alignment program and navigation system.</p>
<p>Failure indicators for the main components of the navigation system are on the
caution/advisory light panels in both cockpits, however, the NAV COMP and IMU
indicators are only present on the RIO cockpit caution/advisory light panel.</p>
<p>The pilot displays (HUD, VDI, and HSD) and the RIO multiple display indicator
are controlled with either the pilot display control panel or the multiple
display indicator control panel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For detailed information on CAP operation, refer to Computer Address Panel

<p>Each window has a designated button. Pressing this button tells the WCS computer
which function of the matrix to use. If OWN AC, WIND, or MAG VAR is pressed,
data can be entered and displayed for each.</p>
<p>Own-aircraft airspeed and magnetic heading are displayed on the TID. If
own-aircraft data file is hooked using the TID cursor, heading will be magnetic.
If OWN AC button was selected (hooked) via the CAP, own-aircraft true heading,
speed (groundspeed), altitude, or course can be displayed on the TID by
depressing the appropriate prefix button:</p>
<ol>
<li>LAT or LONG button will display own-aircraft latitude and longitude.</li>
<li>SPD button displays ground speed and magnetic course.</li>
<li>True airspeed and true heading are displayed when the HDG prefix button is
depressed.</li>
<li>Altitude is displayed on the left TID readout (right is blank) when the ALT
button is used.</li>
<li>When pressing the WIND button, the TID displays present wind speed (left
readout) and magnetic direction (right readout).</li>
<li>The MAG VAR button is used for displaying and entering magnetic variation
(MAG VAR).</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to change own-aircraft lat, long, true heading, or altitude, press the
according prefix button followed by the desired quantity. During entry, the data
is displayed on the upper middle readout on the TID. At the same time, existing
data is being displayed on the two lower readouts. If new data is correct, the
RIO can press the ENTER button and the new values will appear on the readout.</p>
<p>To change wind data entry, press the WIND button, then either the SPD or HDG
prefix button and the appropriate numbers: knots (0 to 512) for speed or degrees
(000 to 359) for magnetic direction. The multiple display indicator data readout
of WIND direction is always displayed as true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In the INS mode, wind is calculated and updated continuously. The manual
entry of wind is ignored by the wind calculations even though the system
accepts the entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depressing the MAG VAR button displays alternating values of computed MAG VAR
(vC) and manual MAG VAR (vM) on the left readout and displays magnetic heading
(MH) on the right readout. The two values alternate every 2 seconds. On the CAP
sign/direction buttons, plus (+) corresponds to east variation and minus (-) to
west variation.</p>
<p>For manual MAG VAR, press the MAG VAR button. Press HDG, E, or W, the angle in
degrees and tenths, and ENTER. Tenths of a degree must be entered even if zero.
The TID displays including the NAV GRID will shift appropriately. Computed MAG
VAR is constantly calculated in the AWG-9 by comparing the IMU’s true heading
with the magnetic heading from AHRS. This difference is saved as computed MAG
VAR. The table below shows the MAG VAR source used by the computer for displays
and CAP entries.</p>
<p>Computed MAG VAR and manual MAG VAR are compared by the AWG-9 computer. If they
differ by a certain value, the acronym MV will alternate with the IN or IM
navigation mode acronym on the TID and HSD. The acronym is cleared when the
difference falls below 5°.</p>

required. Data regarding the hooked point can be displayed on the TID by
pressing the according prefix button. Additionally, the latitude, longitude, and
altitude of the hooked point can be entered by pressing either the LAT, LONG, or
ALT button followed by the desired numbers. Like before, existing data is being

<h3 id="navigational-caution-lights"><a class="header" href="#navigational-caution-lights">Navigational Caution Lights</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the NAV COMP, AHRS, and IMU lights mentioned above, the RIO
caution/advisory panel contains two other advisory lights, C&amp;D HOT and AWG-9
COND, that are indirectly related to navigation system operation. Illumination
of either or both of these lights could mean degraded navigation operation and
would require further investigation of the WCS.</p>
<h2 id="radar-altimeter-system-anapn-194"><a class="header" href="#radar-altimeter-system-anapn-194">Radar Altimeter System (AN/APN-194)</a></h2>
<p>The radar altimeter is a low-altitude (0 to 5,000 feet), pulsed, range-tracking
radar that measures the surface or terrain clearance below the aircraft.
Altitude information is obtained by radiating a short-duration RF pulse from the
transmit antenna to the Earth’s surface and measuring elapsed time until RF
energy returns through the receiver antenna. The altitude is continuously
presented to the pilot on an indicator dial in feet AGL. If either Landing or
Take off mode is selected on the PDCP, radar altitude is displayed on the HUD
from 0 to 1,400 feet.</p>
<p>The radar altimeter can operate in two modes. In the search mode, the system
successively examines increments of range until the complete altitude range is
searched for a return signal. When a return signal is detected, the system
switches to the track mode and tracks the return signal to provide continuous
altitude information.</p>
<p>If the radar altimeter drops out of the track mode, an OFF flag appears and the
pointer is hidden by a mask. The altimeter will remain inoperative until a
return signal is received, at which point the altimeter will display altitude
above ground again. Reliable system operation in the altitude range of 0 to
5,000 feet permits close altitude control at minimum altitudes. The system will
operate normally in bank angles up to 45° and in climbs or dives except when the
reflected signal is too weak.</p>
<p>The system includes a height indicator (altimeter), a test light on the
indicator, a low-altitude warning tone, a radar receiver-transmitter under the
forward cockpit, and two antennas (transmit and receive), one on each side of
the IR fairing, in the aircraft skin. During descent, the warning tone is heard
momentarily when the aircraft passes through the altitude set on the limit
index. When the aircraft is below this altitude, the red low-altitude warning
light on the indicator will stay on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If radar altitude is unreliable, only the OFF flag is present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The radar altimeter has a minimum warmup time of 3 minutes. During warmup,
failure indications and erroneous readouts should be disregarded.</p>
<h3 id="radar-altimeter-1"><a class="header" href="#radar-altimeter-1">Radar Altimeter</a></h3>
<p>The only controls for the system are on the Radar Altimeter on the pilot
instrument panel. The indicator displays radar altitude above the Earth’s
surface on a single-turn dial that is calibrated from 0 to 5,000 feet in
decreasing scale to provide greater definition at lower altitudes. The control
knob in the lower left corner of the indicator is a combination power switch,
self-test switch, and positioning control for the low-altitude limit bug.</p>
<h3 id="altimeter-bit"><a class="header" href="#altimeter-bit">Altimeter BIT</a></h3>
<p>To energize the self-test circuitry press and hold the control knob and the
green test light will illuminate, the indicator will read 100 ±10 feet, and the
HUD altitude scale should read approximately 100 feet. If the indicator passes
below the altimeter limit bug setting, the aural and visual warnings are
triggered. To resume normal operation simply release the control knob again.</p>
<h3 id="low-altitude-audio-warning"><a class="header" href="#low-altitude-audio-warning">Low-Altitude Audio Warning</a></h3>
<p>A low-altitude 1,000-Hz tone provides an aural warning, modulated at two pulses
per second, lasting for 3 seconds. The tone is played to both crew members when
the aircraft descends below the altitude set on the low-altitude limit bug.</p>

operations), used where magnetic reference is unreliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>COMP</strong> - Magnetic north reference direct (flux value), no gyro damping. The
HUD, VDI, HSD, and multiple display indicator use manual magnetic variation
(vM) automatically in this mode.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="steering"><a class="header" href="#steering">Steering</a></h3>
<p>There are two basic types of steering: navigation and attack. Attack steering

<ul>
<li>Navigation steering is computed on either a great circle course or rhumb line
to a fixed point on the Earth’s surface or as a deviation from a selected
course or heading.</li>
<li>The point used for steering can be the RIO’s selected destination (three
waypoints, fixed point, identification point, surface target, or home base), a
TACAN station, ADF information, ACLS information, or a data link waypoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flight-modes-and-steering-sub-modes"><a class="header" href="#flight-modes-and-steering-sub-modes">Flight Modes and Steering Sub-Modes</a></h3>

vertical speed indicator etc. the VDIG format also provides steering cues.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of the flight modes, the pilot can choose between the following five
types of steering commands:</p>
<ul>

<p>The five selections are arranged horizontally along the bottom of the PDCP.
These steering modes determine the display format on the pilot HSD and the RIO
multiple display indicator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HSD and multiple display indicator present, in a horizontal plane,

side and an altitude scale on the right side in the HUD.</li>
<li>Before takeoff, the pilot should check the magnetic heading on top of the HUD

BRC on the carrier, due to the large magnetic distortion on the ship). The
vertical speed indicator should be used to verify a positive climb after
takeoff.</li>
<li>After takeoff, the navigation system normally computes wind and magnetic
variation, which are needed for steering. For backup modes, the WCS uses the
last computed or RIO-entered wind speed, direction, and magnetic variation.</li>

<li>The pilot can set the course or TACAN radial with the CRS control on the HSD.
The TACAN displays are available on the HUD, VDI, HSD, and multiple display
indicator. The HSD and the CMD display TACAN range and the relative bearing to
a selected TACAN station.</li>
<li>To enter the sub-mode, press the TACAN button on the PDCP. After selection of
TACAN course, the HUD and VDI display the TACAN deviation symbol and a TO and
FROM symbology.</li>
<li>On the HSD and multiple display indicator, an arrow on the deviation bar
pointing in the same direction as the TACAN course indicates a course toward
the station, an arrow pointing in the opposite direction indicates a course
away from the station. On the HUD, a dashed line indicates FROM, a solid line
indicates TO. On the VDI, a dark bar indicates FROM, a bright bar indicates
TO.</li>
<li>On the HUD, the deviation symbol moves 3° (linear) in the field of view for a
6° deviation from the selected TACAN radial. These limits prevent the symbol
from leaving the field of view or interfering with the scales on the left and

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There are three steering sub-modes available during landing: TACAN, VEC, and
AWL/PCD.</li>
<li>For the TACAN or VEC sub-modes of LDG, the HUD, VDI, and HSD displays are
similar to the same sub-modes in CRUISE except that in LDG the HUD display
includes the velocity vector symbol, the radar altitude symbol, and the

</ul>
<h4 id="awl-steering"><a class="header" href="#awl-steering">AWL Steering</a></h4>
<p>If ICLS information from the ARA-63 is available at the marshalling area, the
pilot can select the AWL/PCD sub mode. To observe glideslope displays, the HUD
and VDI AWL switches on the pilot display and control panel should be placed in
the ILS position.</p>
<p>The HUD and VDIG will then provide vertical and lateral precision course vector
symbols, forming crossed pointers that are driven by the ICLS. On the HUD,
full-scale vector deflection is limited to 2°. Full-scale vector deflection on
the VDI is 1.5°. In the AWL/PCD sub-mode of LDG, the HSD will additionally
display TACAN information if the HSD is set to NAV mode on the PDCP.</p>
<p>At the acquisition window, the pilot can either continue with the ILS display,
or, if ACL information from the SPN-42 data link is available, he can select ACL
of the AWL switches for either the VDI or HUD displays or both. The ACL display
uses the same vertical and lateral precision course vector symbols as the ICLS,
but these are now driven by the SPN-42 data link. A typical display combination
during the final stages of landing is ILS on the HUD and ACL on the VDI. With
valid ACL data available, the AFCS may be engaged by selecting ACL on the
VEC/PCD, OFF, and ACL switch located on the AFCS control panel.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="inertial-navigation-system-ins"><a class="header" href="#inertial-navigation-system-ins">Inertial Navigation System (INS)</a></h1>
<p>An important feature of the INS is its fast alignment capability over a wide
range of temperature. The INS is a dead-reckoning system that derives speed as a
function of aircraft accelerations. Two accelerometers are used to measure
acceleration in the horizontal plane. These outputs result in velocities along
the X and Y axes after corrections for the Earth’s rotational velocity (coriolis
acceleration) and integration inputs. These X and Y velocities can be resolved
in the IMU platform coordinate system through wander angle and put in the Earth
referenced north/east/down system. Integration about the north and east axes
also provides increments of latitude and longitude. Navigation in such manner
gives the flight crew detailed and precise knowledge of the position, direction
and velocity of their aircraft at any time.</p>
<p>An INS device like the AN/ASN-92 requires a high precision of measurements of
the acceleration and the attitude, because even the smallest inaccuracy can
result in a significant error when accumulated over extended time.</p>
<p>Consider an example: the inertial platform is slightly tilted from the nominal
position, let’s say by 0.002°. Then, the horizontal accelerometers are no longer
parallel to the ground, and this means that they start to be sensitive to
gravity. If not corrected, this gravitational component is interpreted by the
navigation computer as a horizontal acceleration. If the wrong attitude is kept
constant for one hour, it will result in an error of the measured position of
over one nautical mile. It is a significant inaccuracy, and it comes as a result
of such a minimal alignment error.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the INS degrades with time – usually the longer they operate in
the navigation mode, the higher the error they accumulate.</p>
<h2 id="inertial-measurement-unit"><a class="header" href="#inertial-measurement-unit">Inertial Measurement Unit</a></h2>
<p>The IMU is a three-axis, four-gimbal, all-attitude unit containing two gyros and
three accelerometers. The gyros and the accelerometers are mounted to a platform
that is free to rotate with respect to the base (aircraft). The four-gimbal
system provides gimbal-lock free rotation and uses torquer motors to correct
platform attitude errors. The gyros sense angular rotation about their sensitive
axes and are the source of information about the aircraft attitude. They also
stabilize the whole platform and keep the constant orientation of the
accelerometers with respect to the ground (gravity). Two accelerometers are used
to measure acceleration in the horizontal plane; the third accelerometer
measures vertical acceleration. The sensitive axes of the accelerometers are
orthogonal. Their displacement is sensed by pick-off coils that develop a signal
that is amplified, then applied to a torquer that restores the mass to its null
position. The magnitude of torquing current required is proportional to the
acceleration. The sensed acceleration signal is integrated in the computer and
used to calculate aircraft velocity and displacement from the initial position.
The attitude of the platform is also corrected continuously to account for the
effects associated with the Earth’s rotation and device inaccuracies.</p>
<p>This design is widespread for gimballed inertial navigation systems. It was used
for the F-14, but also for the Space Shuttle and many other aircraft of the era.</p>
<h3 id="imu-bit"><a class="header" href="#imu-bit">IMU BIT</a></h3>
<p>In case of IMU failure, the CSDC automatically switches to a backup navigation

electrical characteristics of the IMU.</p>
<p>If the CSDC detects a failure in the IMU, it informs the WCS computer and the

<h3 id="nav-comp-light"><a class="header" href="#nav-comp-light">NAV COMP Light</a></h3>
<p>If the NAV MODE switch is in INS, and the NAV COMP light illuminates, there is a
failure in the INS or CSDC; the navigation system will automatically switch to a

NAV MODE switch to IMU/AM position. The NAV COMP advisory light indicates that
the INS is operating in a degraded mode as a result of manual selection by the
RIO using the NAV MODE switch or automatic selection because of a failure of the
CSDC or the IMU.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When an IMU quantizer failure occurs in the INS mode, the system will

<h3 id="imu-light"><a class="header" href="#imu-light">IMU Light</a></h3>
<p>If there is a failure in the IMU, the IMU advisory light will illuminate; the

Attitude information for the VDIG and missile control system are now provided by
the AHRS. The IMU light remains illuminated until the RIO selects AHRS/AM. With
an AHRS light computed magnetic variation (vC) should be verified and updated if
necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: After RIO selection IMU/AM because of a failure, and a complete
IMU failure occurs afterwards, the system will display erroneous attitude
information to the pilot. The CSDC will neither automatically exit IMU/AM to
the AHRS/AM mode (if a valid AHRS exists) nor remove VDIG/TID/DDD attitude
displays. The RIO should manually switch to the AHRS/AM mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever the NAV COMP light illuminates the flight crew should be cautious of
attitude displays and frequently cross-reference the VDIG/TID/DDD and standby
attitude indicator, particularly during non-VFR conditions and be alert for an
IMU failure. If an IMU failure is indicated by the IMU light, display of IMU
acronym in OBC continuous monitor, removal of the IM acronym in the TID attitude
reference source buffer, and the NAV COMP light goes out, the RIO should move
the NAV MODE switch from the IMU/AM to the AHRS/AM and disregard the READY
light. If a valid AHRS exists, its attitude information will be displayed,
otherwise the VDIG/TID/DDD attitude displays will be removed.</p>
<h3 id="ahrs-light"><a class="header" href="#ahrs-light">AHRS Light</a></h3>
<p>If the AHRS self-test has detected a failure the AHRS Light will illuminate. The
magnetic heading on the HUD and VDI is now controlled by the WCS computer.
Because it uses the last known value for magnetic variation, the heading will
degrade over long distances and time unless new values of magnetic variation are
entered by the RIO via the CAP. IFR flight should be avoided completely.</p>
<h3 id="navigation-power-supply"><a class="header" href="#navigation-power-supply">Navigation Power Supply</a></h3>
<p>The NPS provides electrical power for the IMU and CSDC. A nickel-cadmium battery
provides power to the IMU and CSDC for up to 10 seconds if there is a power
interruption or transient.</p>
<h2 id="ins-alignment-modes"><a class="header" href="#ins-alignment-modes">INS Alignment Modes</a></h2>
<p>Before INS can be used for navigation, the inertial platform must be aligned so
that it is level relative to local vertical and its orientation relative to true
north. This is done automatically in two phases: coarse alignment and fine
alignment.</p>
<p>The coarse phase begins when the initialization sequence is complete and
performs initial coarse estimates of the IMU platform wander angle. The
successful completion of this phase requires a minimum local level error in the
IMU platform to proceed to the fine alignment phase.</p>
<p>IMU elements that require warmup are being heated by the IMU heaters. In
addition, the IMU gimbals (roll, pitch, azimuth) are caged through their
respective synchros to the IMU case (airframe reference). The IMU gyros are
brought up to running speed, and coarse leveling is performed using the
accelerometer outputs.</p>
<p>When power is applied to the NPS and IMU, the SMAL program from the bulk storage
tape is read into the WCS computer non-write-protected memory. The alignment
program estimates a wander angle, velocity errors, and gyro-torquing correction
signals.</p>
<p>These values are sent to the CSDC to align the IMU and to initialize the CSDC
NAV program. The following assemblies are used during alignment: IMU, NPS, CSDC,
WCS computer, CAP (computer address panel), navigation control and data readout
panel. For carrier alignment also the data link receiver-processor is used.</p>
<p>There are four primary alignment modes: SAT ground and carrier alignment, and
NON SAT ground and carrier alignment. SAT operation allows OBC testing during
the alignment. Either alignment mode can be used in SAT or NON SAT. (SAT modes
are not yet implemented in DCS)</p>
<p>The basic TID display formats are represented in the image below. The automatic
sequence is the same for all modes, except for CVA ALIGN, where the ship’s
motion is inserted by the data link.</p>
<p>The CAT ALIGN overrides the requirement for the parking brake to be on (suspend
align). There are two more alignment sub-modes: stored heading and handset. The
handset mode is used for CVA ALIGN when SINS data is not available. The stored
heading mode is used for rapid alignment, by using a previous alignment
(reference alignment) to align the system quickly.</p>
<p>Initialization of any alignment mode requires entry of the following values in
either own aircraft or HB (homebase) for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>Longitude</li>
<li>Corrected pressure altitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if handset alignment is used on the carrier, the following values
must also be entered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Ship’s true heading.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The parking brake must be on during initialization of any alignment. When
the parking brake is released during coarse alignment, the STBY and READY
lights flash and the align program will reinitialize. If the parking brake is
released during fine alignment, a suspend align discrete is sent to the CSDC,
the STBY or READY light blinks, and the time into alignment clock on the TID
stops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/general_navigation_align.jpg" alt="Alignment Display" /></p>
<h2 id="non-sat-alignments"><a class="header" href="#non-sat-alignments">Non-SAT Alignments</a></h2>
<h3 id="ground-alignment"><a class="header" href="#ground-alignment">Ground Alignment</a></h3>
<p>For land-based operations, the ground alignment procedure is used to align the
IMU. Aircraft or homebase latitude, longitude, and altitude are entered into the
WCS computer via the CAP. This may be accomplished before or after selecting GND
align. Selecting GND ALIGN on the NAV MODE switch initiates the align operation.
However note that whatever has been hooked when switching to ALIGN, is injected
as your own coordinates. You can use homebase or preset own aircraft coordinates
for example, but if you didn’t, you will have between 90 to 120 seconds to enter
your own coordinates and you cannot wait for the alignment to finish, or it will
trigger the observable error (O) and alignment will have to be reinitialized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If fine align has not been achieved, entry of the own aircraft’s latitude
will restart the alignment. On completion of the alignment program read-in,
the alignment display appears on the TID.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the initialization, the TID will display an alignment time of 0.7. After
42 to 45 seconds, the NAV COMP light on the caution/advisory panel goes out,
indicating that the IMU has entered the ready state; the READY light also goes
out. The alignment program will begin with the computation of the alignment
parameters.</p>
<p>At this time an alignment status indicator, called a caret (v), will start to
move from left to right. The status of the alignment is indicated by where the
caret appears in relationship to three alignment-tick indicators. The first tick
indicator is called the coarse-align complete marker, the second is the alert
launch criteria marker, and the third indicator is the fine-align complete
marker. An elapsed time indicator provides alignment time in minutes and tenths.</p>
<p>The clock indicator will begin with 0.7 displayed and continue after a 42-second
delay. After 9.9 minutes, the clock display will pass through zero and begin
again. If the alignment is suspended (parking brake), the clock will stop
counting until alignment is resumed.</p>
<p>Between the first and second ticks are the telltale status indicators that
indicate a failure of one of four systems: C = calibration data fail, T =
temperature (cold IMU), S = SINS data invalid, and 0 = observable (alignment
data bad, i.e., LAT, LONG, SPEED, etc.). The letter that appears indicates which
system has a failure.</p>
<p>A C indicates a failure in the transfer of calibration data between the IMU and
the CSDC, and the alignment will not progress.</p>
<p>The T appears normally at the start of alignment and disappears when the IMU has
reached operating temperature. If the T does not disappear, there is a failure
in the system and a non-stored heading alignment will not progress.</p>
<p>The S can appear at the start of any CV alignment and will disappear shortly
after. If the S does not disappear, there is a failure and the result will be a
bad alignment. The S also appears if incoming SINS data is not valid, in which
case the alignment should not be trusted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CSDC and IMU outputs as well as data inputs are constantly monitored and
if either an excessive value in the X or Y acceleration is sensed, or a bad
value from wrong lat or long data input, a 0 (bad observable) is posted on
the TID and the alignment stalls (ceases to continue).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IMU may be preheated by selecting IMU/AM on the TID NAV MODE switch when
operating on ground or aircraft power. This energizes the IMU and navigation
power supply, which turns on the IMU heater prior to start of a ground or
carrier alignment. The IMU should not be preheated for longer than 5
minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During coarse alignment, the alignment caret moves based on the wander angle
error. If the parking brake is released during this phase, the alignment will
reset.</p>
<p>The V will reach the first tick when coarse alignment is complete. When the
program switches to fine alignment, the caret changes into a diamond, which
indicates to the pilot that he may release the parking brake (suspend alignment)
and taxi, if OBC is complete. After the parking brake is reset, alignment will
continue and the diamond will move right as alignment improves.</p>
<p>At the second tick, which indicates that alignment meets the minimum criteria to
launch weapons, the STBY light will go off and the READY light will illuminate.
The INS mode may be entered at this point. If INS is not selected, the diamond
continues to move to the right. When it reaches the third tick, it indicates
that fine alignment is completed and a dot will appear in the diamond (&lt;&gt;).</p>
<p>You can leave the system in alignment mode even after fine align is complete,
which will provide a progressively more accurate alignment. How much more
accuracy is gained depends on the quality of alignment when fine align was
completed. This can be rather minimal in some cases, but, when it is further
left in alignment for long enough, it will always provide a certain amount of
improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If alignment is suspended and the aircraft is taxied over a distance
greater than 4000 feet, the quality of the alignment becomes unknown to a
point where it might be unreliable. Alignment reinitialization is advised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the caret (v) or diamond stop moving, the program has stopped aligning. If
they stop between the first and third ticks (coarse and fine), it means that
alignment has been suspended. The clock will stop counting if that is the case.
If alignment continues, the clock resumes counting until switched out of
alignment by NAV MODE switch or if the parking brake is released again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The alignment display will not go past the coarse align tick until the IMU
temperature has reached 165°. When this temperature is reached, the T symbol
will disappear. The temperature interlock is bypassed when performing a stored
heading alignment. The IMU should be preheated for a stored heading alignment,
as it usually completes in under 2 minutes, which could result in a bad
alignment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selecting INS will turn off the READY light, terminate alignment and the
tactical display will appear, and the normal navigation display will become
available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the NAV MODE switch is set to INS, the CSDC is in navigation mode and
the READY light goes out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After selecting the INS navigation mode, the AWG-9 align program continues
for approximately three align data cycles (18 seconds) before entering INS.
This also applies if the aircraft takes off before INS is selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The RIO and pilot can then observe an IN acronym on the attitude status readout
on the TID or TID repeat.</p>
<p>If you want to reinitialize an alignment when observing an acronym during fine
alignment or if noting a stalled alignment, the following methods can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select both INS mode switch and WCS PWR switch to off. Allow TID displays to
collapse. Proceed with normal start sequence.</li>
<li>INS mode switch to desired align mode.</li>
<li>INS mode switch to INS. Verify system in INS (IN acronym on TID), cycle mode
switch to off and back to desired alignment mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to follow above procedures when reinitializing a fine alignment will
result in severely degraded alignment quality. To reinitialize the program
during coarse align, the RIO has to unselect GND ALIGN, re-enter LAT and LONG
and reselect GND ALIGN.</p>
<h3 id="carrier-alignment"><a class="header" href="#carrier-alignment">Carrier Alignment</a></h3>
<p>When aligning on a carrier with a changing latitude, longitude, and heading, the
carrier alignment procedure is used. INS can be aligned in three different ways
on a carrier: with RF data link alignment and manual (handset) alignment -
deck-edge cable alignment is not implemented in DCS. TID displays the same
information as during a GND ALIGN procedure.</p>
<p>Note that you will get erroneous heading readings on a carrier, even if fine
align is complete. The heading can deviate up to 20 or 30 degrees, depending on
the parking position on the carrier and the carrier’s heading, due to the
carrier’s own magnetic field and induced magnetic field. It is important that
the flight crew know the carrier’s BRC. The magnetic variation caused by the
carrier’s magnetic distortion will go away shortly after take off. This magnetic
distortion does not impact the alignment quality.</p>
<h4 id="carrier-data-link-alignment"><a class="header" href="#carrier-data-link-alignment">Carrier Data Link Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The primary carrier alignment mode is the RF data link alignment (CAINS). This
mode uses the ship’s INS (SINS) to align the IMU. Inertial inputs including the
ship’s longitude, latitude, north and east velocity as well as roll, pitch,
heading, and heading rate are transmitted to the WCS computer via the RF data
link.</p>
<p>The data is transmitted by the ship’s data link equipment. To align the INS by
the CVA alignment method, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on the power to the data link system</li>
<li>Turn the WCS power to STBY</li>
<li>Set the D/L mode on the DATA LINK control panel to CAINS/WAYPT</li>
<li>Select CVA ALIGN on the NAV MODE switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The received data is processed by the data link equipment in the aircraft and
transmitted to the WCS computer. The WCS computer compares the IMU data with the
ship’s INS data and sends correction signals to the CSDC to fine align the IMU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If CVA or CAT ALIGN is selected prior to selecting OBC BIT, data link OBC
testing is inhibited. (Not implemented yet)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fine alignment complete tick mark indicates completion of fine align and
whether alignment data is SINS or handset. When good SINS data is not
received during a filter cycle, the fine alignment complete tick mark jumps
to the left approximately 0.75 inches. The jump indicates the SINS data is
intermittent, and handset alignment data is required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>CVA ALIGN is much similar to GND ALIGN, and alignment is suspended, stalled, and
reinitialized in the same manner as during GND ALIGN, depending on whether it
has been induced during the coarse or fine alignment phase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If SINS data link is lost during taxi, a flashing HS will appear on the
TID. This will disappear when data link is reacquired; however, because of
align timing requirements, it may remain flashing up to 8 seconds after data
link is reacquired. If the HS flashing does not stop 8 seconds after resetting
the parking brake, SINS data is lost but the alignment can continue by
entering carrier speed and true heading into the own aircraft file and
completing the align in handset mode. If datalink is reacquired during this
period, the HS will disappear from the TID and a normal datalink CVA align
will continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To complete the alignment, set the NAV MODE switch to INS. A successfully
aligned INS is indicated by both the STBY and READY lights off and the IN
acronym in the status readout on the TID.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not switch to INS while the ship is in a turn, even if fine align has
been completed. This will degrade the alignment quality significantly. If
you wait until the ship’s turn is complete, alignment quality will not be
affected. Handset alignment is not affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If during a CVA alignment the CAINS/WAYPT-TAC switch is unlatched to TAC by
power transient, or data link signal is lost, the INS will revert to a
handset alignment (HS).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="carrier-cable-alignment"><a class="header" href="#carrier-cable-alignment">Carrier Cable Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The deck-edge cable alignment (SINS) is an alternative to the RF data link
alignment, where inputs are sent over a secure cable to the data link from the
deck-edge outlet box of the carrier. Switching from RF data link to cable inputs
is done automatically when the cable is connected. To initiate a CVA align with
SINS via cable, use the same steps as for the RF data link alignment. As cable
and RF data link alignment are virtually the same, it has not been implemented
in DCS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The SINS-cable is currently not implemented in DCS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="handset-alignment"><a class="header" href="#handset-alignment">Handset Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The HS alignment mode is a manual alignment option available for carrier
alignment, should SINS data from RF data link or cable not be available,
inaccurate, or interrupted (indicated by the TILT light on the DDI and/or the
fine alignment complete tick mark jumping to the left about 0.75 inches). The HS
is also very similar to the GND ALIGN mode, but the RIO has to input more data
and the computer takes longer to process because of the ship movement.</p>
<p>IF CVA ALIGN is selected with the NAV MODE switch and no SINS data is available,
a flashing HS acronym will appear on the TID. Whenever HS flashes on the TID
before alignment starts and the RIO chooses to align the system with handset
align, he must enter the according ship’s data in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Ship’s true heading</li>
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>Longitude</li>
<li>Corrected pressure altitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>If during coarse align data link is lost (RF or cable) or during any portion of
a stored heading alignment, the alignment will reinitialize and the HS acronym
will be flashing. The alignment can then be continued with the handset mode as
described above.</p>
<p>If the reinitialization occurs during the fine align phase of a stored heading
alignment, the CSDC alignment routine must be reset first by turning the AWG-9
OFF for 6 seconds.</p>
<p>If data link is lost during a normal fine align phase, HS will be entered
automatically, but the acronym will not flash and the alignment will continue.
If data link is regained, the HS acronym will disappear and normal CVA align via
RF or cable data link will continue. When data link is regained, the acronym can
remain for up to 8 seconds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If HS is not flashing, valid SINS data has already been entered. If it is
flashing, SINS data has to be entered manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the CAP NAV DATA matrix use OWN AC, and the LAT and LONG prefix push buttons;
to enter the ships’ heading and speed use own-aircraft HDG and SPD buttons. Once
this data has been entered HS will stop flashing and the alignment will progress
like a normal GND ALIGN, but can take up to 3 times as long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The carrier needs to maintain a constant speed and heading during alignment
for this method to be successful. Remember that handset alignment quality will
always be inferior to a normal CVA ALIGN fine alignment quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reinitialization"><a class="header" href="#reinitialization">Reinitialization</a></h3>
<p>To reinitialize an alignment during the fine align phase, if an observable
acronym (O) or a stalled alignment has been noticed, the RIO can use any of the
following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set NAV MODE switch and WCS switch to OFF. Allow TID displays to collapse.
Proceed with normal start sequence.</li>
<li>Set NAV MODE switch to OFF. Set NAV MODE switch to desired align mode.</li>
<li>Set NAV MODE switch to INS. Verify system in INS (IN acronym on TID). Cycle
NAV MODE switch to OFF and back to desired alignment mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failing to follow above procedures when reinitializing a fine alignment will
result in severely degraded alignment quality. To reinitialize the program
during coarse align, the RIO has to unselect GND ALIGN, re-enter LAT and LONG
and reselect GND ALIGN.</p>
<h2 id="stored-heading-alignment"><a class="header" href="#stored-heading-alignment">Stored Heading Alignment</a></h2>
<p>A feature of the INS that allows for quick-reaction response is the
stored-heading alignment. The aircraft has to be parked and tied down in the
alert position (wheel-chocks in DCS) for this procedure to be successful.
Additionally, the aircraft heading has to be stored with a reference alignment
before the aircraft is being powered down (and back up again).</p>
<p>When the aircraft is powered back up, the system takes less than 2 minutes to
align the INS from the stored heading, while providing almost the same accuracy
like a full, fine ground or carrier alignment. When align is selected and a
reference alignment is available, an ASH acronym for automatic stored heading
will be displayed on the TID and STORED HDG ALIGN will illuminate on the CAP.
The ASH acronym tells the RIO that a stored heading has been entered
automatically.</p>
<p>No further action from the RIO is needed, ASH align will continue and ASH will
remain on the TID as an advisory. Pressing once on the STORED HDG ALIGN on the
CAP will end the ASH align and initiate normal alignment. The ASH acronym will
disappear. Pressing the STORED HDG ALIGN a second time will reinitialize the
stored heading alignment, however ASH won’t be displayed on the TID anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 STBY/READY lights should be monitored for simultaneous illumination. If
simultaneous illumination appears after 42 to 45 seconds, a failure has caused
the alignment to re-initiate and may result in an erroneous alignment. The RIO
must turn NAV MODE switch to OFF for 1 second, then restart the alignment
following normal ground or carrier alignment procedures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference alignment can be done with either internal or external power. To
do a reference alignment, enter the latitude and longitude via the CAP into the
own-aircraft file. This can be achieved by an automatic transfer from homebase
entry into own-aircraft before selecting GND ALIGN, or entry into own-aircraft
file after GND ALIGN has been selected.</p>
<p>The aircraft’s latitude and longitude can be entered into homebase and
transferred into own-aircraft file through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the NAV MODE switch to GND ALIGN.</li>
<li>Select CAP category TAC DATA.</li>
<li>Depress HOME BASE and enter aircraft longitude and latitude via the CAP data
entry buttons.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aircraft latitude and longitude can be entered directly through the following
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the NAV MODE switch to either OFF or GND ALIGN.</li>
<li>Select CAP category NAV.</li>
<li>Depress OWN A/C and enter aircraft longitude and latitude via the CAP data
entry buttons.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Depressing OWN A/C hooks own aircraft. If longitude and latitude is entered
with the NAV MODE switch set to OFF, own aircraft must be hooked when the NAV
MODE switch is set from OFF to GND ALIGN again. Be aware that whatever has
been hooked (OWN AC or HB) will provide the data that is entered when NAV MODE
is set from OFF to GND ALIGN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a reference alignment, alignment has to reach fine align complete. Both CVA
ALIGN and GND ALIGN can be used to establish a reference alignment. The
reference alignment is complete when a dot appears in the diamond.</p>
<p>To establish a reference alignment follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>WCS switch - STBY.</li>
<li>NAV MODE - CVA or GND.</li>
<li>DATA LINK - ON (CV ops only).</li>
<li>D/L MODE - CAINS/WAYPT (CV ops only).</li>
<li>Reference alignment continues to fine align complete.</li>
<li>NAV MODE switch to INS.</li>
<li>WCS - OFF.</li>
<li>NAV MODE - OFF.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Unstable current or temporary loss of power will cause the CAINS to be
deselected and will be indicated by a flashing HS acronym. A reference
alignment cannot be done through a handset alignment, even if continued to
fine align complete. For a successful reference alignment the aircraft must
not move and the parking brake must not be cycled after the reference heading
has been stored. For a valid reference alignment, it isn’t necessary to switch
NAV MODE to INS, instead it can be switched directly to OFF from either CVA or
GND ALIGN.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="catapult-alignment"><a class="header" href="#catapult-alignment">Catapult Alignment</a></h2>
<p>The CAT ALIGN mode is used to prevent suspend align when positioned on the
catapult and the parking brake has been released. The purpose of the catapult
align mode is to provide normal CVA ALIGN as long as possible. When CAT ALIGN is
selected, large roll, pitch, speed, and heading changes of the ship can cause
the program to automatically switch to INS.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-fix-update"><a class="header" href="#navigation-fix-update">Navigation Fix Update</a></h2>
<p>An error of latitude or longitude in the computer position of the aircraft can
be corrected by a navigation fix update. Updating is especially important in the
backup modes (AHRS AM and IMU/ AM) because of the estimated winds and magnetic
variation changes. A nav fix is done via a ground-reference-point (latitude and
longitude) position. The range and bearing of this position to the present
aircraft position is used to update or correct existing values. The nav system
may be updated by either a radar fix, a TACAN fix, or a visual fix.</p>
<p>Before performing a nav fix, the latitude and longitude of the desired update
point (radar, TACAN, or visual) must be stored in one of eight navigation point
locations (three WPs, FIX PT, HOME BASE, HOST AREA, DEF PT, and IP). This data
can be stored prior to flight by data link or by manual insertion. Then follow
these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook the Waypoint you choose to select for the nav fix.</li>
<li>Check the stored latitude and longitude on the TID.</li>
<li>Rotate the CATEGORY switch to NAV and select the desired type of update.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that updating the position while in INS, and to a lesser degree while in
IMU, can introduce a greater navigational position error than already present,
in particular if a radar fix is used to update the nav system. Updates with a
visual or TACAN fix provide reasonable accuracy (assuming a good MAG VAR during
TACAN updates). Updating your nav system via a nav fix should be primarily used
in the AHRS mode.</p>
<h2 id="radar-update"><a class="header" href="#radar-update">Radar Update</a></h2>
<p>A RDR FIX may be selected before or after positioning the DDD cursors. If the
RDR FIX button is depressed, the computer computes the present position of the
aircraft by measuring the range and bearing from the selected point. The delta
between the computer position and the position determined by the INS is then
displayed on the TID. If entry of this delta into the navigation computations is
desired, press the FIX ENABLE button. If the delta does not appear to be
correct, the computer and the readout can be cleared by pressing the RDR FIX
button. The fix may then be attempted again. The RIO should also perform
periodic checks of own aircraft system altitude and update the altitude if
necessary.</p>
<p>Radar updating is performed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>TID CURSOR/CAP - Hook Desired Navigation Point for Update.</li>
<li>PULSE SRCH button - Depress.</li>
<li>On sensor control panel: STAB switch - IN. EL BARS switch - 1. AZ SCAN
switch - As Desired.</li>
<li>RDR FIX button - Depress.</li>
<li>DDD CURSOR button - Depress.</li>
<li>Action switch - Half Action (first detent).</li>
<li>Cursor is displayed on DDD.</li>
<li>Manipulate hand control DDD cursor over desired ground map point.</li>
<li>Action switch - Full Action and Release. (This will cause the DDD cursor to
remain at the selected position.)</li>
<li>Observe the delta for LAT and LONG on TID.</li>
<li>If readouts are unsatisfactory, deselect RDR FIX and repeat steps 4
through 12.</li>
<li>FIX ENABLE button - Depress.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To clear the previous hooked DDD cursor position, go to half action and
then release prior to initiating full action for the new position hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tacan-update"><a class="header" href="#tacan-update">TACAN Update</a></h2>
<p>To perform a nav fix by TACAN, it requires that a pre-stored waypoint shares
identical LAT and LONG values with the TACAN station that will be used for the
fix. Select the TACAN channel for the desired station and verify by listening to
the coded identifier tone in the headset.</p>
<p>Press the TACAN FIX button to update the aircraft position from a TACAN station.
The WCS computer then calculates the own aircraft position error based on the
range and bearing from the TACAN station. The delta is then entered in the same
manner as with a radar fix.</p>
<p>Perform a TACAN fix following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a TACAN channel whose latitude and longitude correspond to an update
point.</li>
<li>Hook the desired update point (WAYPT 1, FIX PT, HOME BASE, etc.).</li>
<li>CATEGORY switch - NAV.</li>
<li>TACAN FIX button - Depress.</li>
<li>Observe the present position delta readout.</li>
<li>If delta is unsatisfactory, deselect TACAN FIX and repeat steps 2 through 7.</li>
<li>FIX ENABLE button - Depress.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 During a TACAN FIX, the MAG VAR must be the same as the TACAN station
magnetic variation, or the update will be in error. Given a TACAN station with
a range of 100 NM from ownship, a 1°MAG VAR error introduces a 1.74nm error
into the ownship’s TACAN update.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="visual-update"><a class="header" href="#visual-update">Visual Update</a></h2>
<p>To perform a visual fix, fly over a pre-stored waypoint and press the VIS FIX
button. Estimate your timing, because the aircraft nose and fuselage can obscure
the fix point during overflight. It is also difficult to estimate when directly
overhead a waypoint if the aircraft altitude is greater than 10,000 feet. The
delta for the visual fix is displayed on the TID. Enter the delta by pressing
FIX ENABLE.</p>
<p>To perform a visual fix use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook the desired update point (WAY PT, HB, IP, etc.).</li>
<li>Select NAV category on CAP.</li>
<li>Overfly the selected pre-stored point and when over the point, depress the
VIS FIX button on the cap.</li>
<li>If the delta is not satisfactory, press VIS FIX again to clear the delta and
repeat from step 1.</li>
<li>If a satisfactory delta is displayed, depress the FIX ENABLE button; this
causes the delta correction of own-aircraft position to be inserted into the
computer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-link-update"><a class="header" href="#data-link-update">Data Link Update</a></h2>
<p>To perform a data link update of the aircraft INS to the TDS frame of reference,
the aircraft and TDS must share a pre-briefed waypoint, identical in latitude
and longitude. Enter this LAT/LONG data into the HOST AREA pseudo target file.
The TDS will uplink the common reference point as a data link waypoint. When the
aircraft and TDS INS systems agree, the data link waypoint and host area symbols
will be superimposed on the TID. If they drift apart, the two pseudo targets on
the TID will drift as well.</p>
<p>To perform an update via data link, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook the data link waypoint corresponding pre-briefed reference point.</li>
<li>Select the NAV category on CAP.</li>
<li>Overfly the hooked data link waypoint. When immediately over the point, press
VIS FIX button on CAP.</li>
<li>Observe delta LAT and LONG on TID.</li>
<li>If deltas are satisfactory and update is desired, depress FIX ENABLE.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a data link update, HOST AREA and data link waypoint should be
superimposed on the TID again.</p>
<h2 id="fighter-to-fighter-navigation-update"><a class="header" href="#fighter-to-fighter-navigation-update">Fighter-to-Fighter Navigation Update</a></h2>
<p>Net aircraft that use fighter-to-fighter data link can update their navigation
system in the FF/DL mode. To update LAT/LONG hook the net aircraft symbol of an
aircraft that is in close proximity and select F/F NAV UPDATE on the CAP. This
will enter the hooked aircraft’s coordinates into the INS as own-aircraft
coordinates. To update the nav system on an aircraft that is not close, first
obtain a radar STT on that aircraft, hook the STT-ed aircraft on the TID and
then press F/F NAV UPDATE on the CAP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 By updating to the selected aircraft’s INS, its calibration/drift can
potentially introduce a larger error into your own INS. Both aircraft will
share the same error though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="position-marking"><a class="header" href="#position-marking">Position Marking</a></h2>
<p>To mark the position of a pulse radar target, a visual target, or a TACAN
station to be displayed on the TID, use the SURF TGT position in the TAC DATA
category. Once displayed on the TID, latitude, longitude, range, bearing, and
steering data are available, using the CAP or the navigation destination control
or both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Do not use the position SURF TGT to update the navigation computer. The
surface target position symbol is repositioned with respect to own aircraft
instead of own aircraft being updated in reference to the surface target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To mark a pulse radar target on the TID, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the SURF TGT button.</li>
<li>Establish the location via a radar fix.</li>
<li>Select the DDD CURSOR and use the pulse system for radar mapping.</li>
<li>Designate the point of interest by placing the cursor over that point.</li>
<li>Selecting full action.</li>
<li>Select RDR FIX.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will display a delta from the hooked point to the surface target. Ignore
the delta and select FIX ENABLE to position the surface target over the
previously identified radar position. A very accurate readout of latitude,
longitude, and steering information will become available for the Surface Target
Waypoint.</p>
<p>The method for visual targets is the same, but a visual fix is required. You can
also mark a TACAN station by using the same method and following the TACAN fix
procedures. After completing any of the above procedures, the SURF TGT symbol
will be displayed on the TID at the computed latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
<p>The surface target symbol can also be used as a destination point. If its
position has been previously entered, the symbol will appear on the TID. One
method for special position marking is to hook any point on the TID and select
SURF TGT. The surface target symbol now appears over the hooked point and its
new position will be stored in the WCS computer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="attitude-and-heading-reference-set-ahrs"><a class="header" href="#attitude-and-heading-reference-set-ahrs">Attitude and Heading Reference Set (AHRS)</a></h1>
<p>The AHRS provides backup pitch and roll information to the CSDC and WCS
computer, if attitude data from the INS is not available. At any time, the AHRS
provides prime magnetic heading to the BDHI for direct analog display and to the
CSDC where it is converted to digital information for the VDIG, MDIG, and the
WCS. Additionally, the autopilot gets its heading reference from the AHRS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The only analog cockpit display for magnetic heading is the BDHI. The HUD,
VDI, TID, HSD, and multiple display indicator are digital and receive their
inputs from the AHRS through the CSDC. Thus. in case of a CSDC failure, the
only magnetic heading is displayed on the BDHI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main assemblies of the AHRS are a two-gyro platform (vertical and
directional displacement gyros), an electronic control amplifier, a compass
controller, a magnetic azimuth detector, and an electronic compensator.</p>
<p>In case of an IMU failure, the CSDC automatically selects AHRS attitude
information for display and autopilot control. The directional gyro smoothens
the flux valve heading signal in the SLAVED mode or provides a direct heading
reference in the DG mode. The resulting heading is transmitted to the BDHI, the
CSDC, and the WCS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the INS nav mode IMU true heading is used and must be converted to
magnetic heading by adding or subtracting the magnetic variation to have a
backup magnetic value, if needed. Under normal operation, AHRS magnetic
heading is used for all displays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AHRS is unlimited in roll but limited to 82° in pitch. If the pitch
attitude exceeds ±82, it will precess. A gradual precession in roll, pitch,
and heading can also be expected in sustained turns at slow rates (less than
6° per minute). Large roll and pitch precession errors can be corrected by
flying straight and level, without accelerating, and pressing and holding
the HDG set button on the compass controller panel. Pressing and holding
this button corrects precession errors at a rate of 12° per minute minimum.
The HDG set button should be held for at least 3 minutes. Before repeating
the 3-minute cycle, it should be released for at least 1 minute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="compass-controller-panel"><a class="header" href="#compass-controller-panel">Compass Controller Panel</a></h2>
<p>Use the compass controller panel to select one of three compass modes when the
AHRS is used as a heading reference. For a description, see Compass Control
Panel.</p>
<p>When magnetic heading references are unreliable, operate the system in the DG
mode. When the magnetic reference is reliable, operate the system in the SLAVED
mode. When DG or SLAVED modes are inoperable, the COMP mode can be used for
emergencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If both the IMU and the AHRS fail, pitch and roll attitude indications from
the HUD, TID, and DDD will be removed, and the IMU and AHRS advisory lights
illuminate. Select COMP mode on the compass controller panel to possibly
restore valid magnetic heading information to the HUD, VDI, and HSD, the AHRS
advisory lights will go off. Disregard the invalid pitch and roll attitude
information that will be restored to the HUD and VDI.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ahrs-operation"><a class="header" href="#ahrs-operation">AHRS Operation</a></h2>
<p>As a compass, the AHRS operates in three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The directional gyro (DG) mode provides a free-gyro heading reference with
Earth-rate correction.</li>
<li>The SLAVED mode provides a gyro-stabilized magnetic heading</li>
<li>And the compass (COMP) mode provides an emergency magnetic heading from the
compass transmitter only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the COMP mode is selected, the AFCS is automatically disengaged to prevent
erratic steering commands. The COMP mode cannot provide a sufficiently stable
heading signal for AFCS operation and should only be used for emergencies. To
erect the AHRS, press and hold the HDG set button on the compass controller (3
minutes on, 1 minute off cycle) until the needle of the synchronous indicator is
bracketing the null mark.</p>
<p>If nav mode is set to INS or IMU/AM, attitude displays will continue to indicate
properly when the AHRS pitch limit of 82° is exceeded, but all displays of
magnetic heading will be in error and the advisory lights may be on or off. If
this is encountered, accurate and stable magnetic heading displays on the HUD,
VDI, HSD, TID, and multiple display indicator can be regained immediately by
inserting the proper MAG VAR via the computer address panel.</p>

<p>The TACAN system indicates a slant range accurate to within 0.1 NM and a bearing
of 0.5° to any surface station selected. Slant range to airborne stations is
provided with an air-to-air (A/A) mode. The operating range is approximately 300
NM, if line of sight is given.</p>
<p>The system offers 126 operating channels in each of 2 modes. Receiving
frequencies for surface-to-air operation are 962 to 1024 MHz and 1151 to 1213
MHz, for air-to-air operations, the frequencies are from 1025 to 1150 MHz. The
TACAN uses two antennas that automatically switch in a 6-second interval until a
threshold signal is received. Note that the TACAN can take up to 2 minutes to
warm up when turned on for the first time after a cold start.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-modes"><a class="header" href="#tacan-modes">TACAN Modes</a></h2>
<p>The system is capable of receiving valid signals from a ground station
simultaneously with 99 other aircraft in either REC or T/R mode.</p>
<p>In the A/A mode, the system is capable of transponding with each of five
cooperating aircraft, indicating slant range information to each, but the system
will interrogate and lock on to only one at a time.</p>
<p>Both pilot and RIO share Identical TACAN control panels on the left consoles.
Individual TACAN CMD buttons on both the pilot and RIO left consoles provide
transfer of TACAN control between pilot and RIO. Control of TACAN is indicated
by a flip-flop indicator in each cockpit showing PLT (pilot) or RIO. Either
crewman may adjust the audio level of the identification signal. For TACAN panel
description see TACAN Control Panel.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-displays"><a class="header" href="#tacan-displays">TACAN Displays</a></h2>
<p>Bearing and distance to a TACAN station are displayed on the BDHI, the HSD, and
the multiple display indicator. Deviation to the TACAN station is displayed on
the HUD and VDI (VDIG) and the HSD and multiple display indicator.</p>
<p>The MDIG displays TACAN bearing marker, deviation ticks, range-to-TACAN station,
and course. The HUD and VDI display provide a TACAN deviation bar, which is
coded, on the HUD: solid line - TO station, dashed line - FROM station and on
the VDI: bright bar - TO station, dark bar - FROM station.</p>
<p>TACAN information is also displayed on both the pilot’s and RIO’s identical
BDHI. The bearing and distance functions of the BDHI come alive when the TACAN
mode select switch is set to T/R. In the REC and T/R modes, magnetic bearings
are displayed by the No.2 (large) needle, which unlocks and enters a search mode
(spins) whenever bearing information is unreliable.</p>
<p>Range information received in T/R or A/A mode is displayed in nautical miles on
the distance counter. An OFF flag covers the counter window if the range
information is unreliable or not available. TACAN information is also displayed
on the pilot HSD, HUD, and VDI and on the RIO multiple display indicator in
other navigation modes.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-operation"><a class="header" href="#tacan-operation">TACAN Operation</a></h2>
<p>If after approximately 2 minutes warm up time the range and bearing indications
continue to search when a reliable station is selected, check circuit breakers

antenna manually; there is no automatic actuation function in these aircraft.
The data link (DIL) antennas are similarly selected manually. Upper or lower
antenna is selected by means of ANTENNA switches on the DATA LINK control panel.
The UHF 1 voice communication ARC-159 antenna is shared with the DIL antenna
system and is always on the opposite antenna from the one selected by the
ANTENNA switch.</p>
<p>The upper V/UHF 2/TACAN antenna is the first one aft of the canopy on the
turtleback, and the lower antenna is embedded in the bottom of the left ventral
fin. Only one antenna is used at a time. Automatic switching between antennas
prevents the loss of TACAN information. If a signal is lost or is too weak to
hold receiver lockup, the TACAN automatically cycles between the two antennas
every 6 seconds seeking a stronger signal.</p>
<p>During this cycling and search period, memory circuits retain range tracking for
8 to 12 seconds and bearing tracking for 8 seconds. The IFF antenna lobing
switch is controlled by the IFF ANT switch on the RIO right outboard console. In
AUTO, the lobing switch cycles the receiver-transmitter between the upper and
lower antenna. In the LWR (lower) position, only the lower antenna is used to
receive and transmit signals. The upper antenna pattern has a slight forward
tilt; the lower pattern a slight aft tilt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In real life, it is often necessary to select LWR to improve ground station
reception. However, due to the limitations of DCS, antenna switching is not
modeled and thus not functional. The use of antennas is automated and/or
neglected for the player. All radios and radio functions work through proper
keying.</p>

<p>The ICS provides normal, backup, or emergency communications between
crewmembers. It also combines and amplifies audio signals received from other
electronic receiving equipment (ECM, Sidewinder tone, IFF/SIF, radar altimeter,
and voice radios, etc.). Identical ICS control panels are on the pilot and RIO
left side consoles. The ICS consists of four amplifiers, two at each cockpit
station, which permit duplex operation during normal operation. If one amplifier
fails, it may be bypassed by selecting either the B/U (backup) or EMER
(emergency) position on the ICS control panel. This permits continued ICS
operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If two amplifiers fail at the same station, intercommunication is
impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 By selecting EMER on the respective ICS control panel and using the other
crewmember’s amplifier, you can listen in on audio normally only available at
that station (like SW-tone or ALQ-126 PRF) but you lose the ability to control
the volume of the audio you listen to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The external interphone connection is in the nose-wheel well. When the pilot ICS
switch is set to HOT MIC, ground personnel can communicate with the cockpit
stations. In DCS, this works through selecting the ground crew communication
menu in the DCS radio communication menu when activating ICS PTT.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="systems/nav_com/com/../../../img/general_communications_throttle.jpg" alt="throttle" /></th><th><img src="systems/nav_com/com/../../../img/general_communications_ics.jpg" alt="ics" /></th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>The Pilot Radio ICS button allows for various intercommunication and radio
operation modes. When set to ICS, it permits intercommunication when COLD MIC is
selected on the function selector, overriding UHF/VHF communications. In the
BOTH position, it keys both radios for operation, although this function is not
active in DCS. The UHF 1 position keys the ARC-159 radio, and the UHF 2 position
keys the ARC-182 radio.</p>
<p>The VOL control is used to control the intercommunication audio level at the
specific cockpit station where it is adjusted. The audio levels at other
stations remain unaffected by changes to this control.</p>
<p>The Amplifier selector has three positions: B/U (Backup), NORM (Normal), and
EMER (Emergency). The B/U position is used to bypass a faulty amplifier,
utilizing a backup output amplifier at the current station. The NORM position is
for normal operation when all amplifiers are functioning correctly. The EMER
position bypasses a faulty amplifier and uses the input amplifier of the other
station, though HOT MIC is not available in this mode. It is important to note
that with the front cockpit amplifier selector switch in the EMER position,
engine stall/overtemperature and Sidewinder tones will not be available to the
pilot.</p>
<p>The Function selector has multiple settings to manage radio and
intercommunication audio. The RADIO OVERRIDE setting attenuates noncritical
radio audio to prioritize intercommunication when urgent. The HOT MIC setting
allows for intercommunication without keying, while the COLD MIC setting
requires the pilot to actuate the ICS keying switch on the inboard throttle or
the RIO to actuate the keying switch on the left footrest for
intercommunication.</p>
<p>The RIO’s ICS button located on the left footrest permits intercommunication if
COLD MIC is selected on the function selector control, overriding UHF
communication. The RIO’s MIC button, found on the right footrest, allows for the
transmission of UHF 1 or UHF 2 radios as selected on the communications/TACAN
command panel. Note the BOTH function is not active in DCS.</p>

<p>The Data Link Reply and Antenna Control Panel is used to select what antenna to
use, own aircraft data link address, whether to transmit and which mode the Link
4A is used in.</p>
<p>The <strong>ANTENNA</strong> switch (<num>1</num>) sets if the data link uses the upper or
lower antenna. As these are the same antennas that the UHF 1 (AN/ARC-159) uses
it automatically sets that radio to the other antenna.</p>
<p>The <strong>REPLY</strong> switch (<num>2</num>) sets whether own aircraft replies to data
link messages. <strong>NORM</strong> allows for normal operation while <strong>CANC</strong> turns off the
transmitter and sets the data link to receive only.</p>
<p>The <strong>MODE</strong> switch (<num>3</num>) controls whether the Link 4A operates in the
normal <strong>TAC</strong> (Tactical) mode or the <strong>CAINS/WAYPT</strong> (Carrier Aircraft Inertial
Navigation System/Waypoint) mode. The TAC mode is the normal airborne mode while
the CAINS/WAYPT mode is used while on the carrier deck to receive preflight
waypoints and INS alignment data from the ships INS system. The switch is
solenoid held and spring-loaded to the TAC position, if the data link reception
is lost or the power lost the switch automatically returns to the TAC mode,
forcing an ongoing INS alignment to the backup handset mode. If the aircraft
takes off with the switch in the CAINS/WAYPT position the weight on wheels
sensor will also release it to TAC.</p>
<p>The two address thumbwheel sets the least significant bits (two lowest numbers)
of the aircraft data link address, the rest has to be set by the ground crew.</p>
<h2 id="link-4-in-dcs"><a class="header" href="#link-4-in-dcs">Link 4 in DCS</a></h2>
<p>The Link 4 implementation in the Heatblur DCS F-14 implements both the Link 4A
and C versions.</p>
<p>To use Link 4A the data link has to be powered on, set to Link 4A mode (ON) and
tuned to the correct data link frequency for the desired host which can be found
on the kneeboard. On the ground and set to the CAINS/WAYPT mode the data link
will receive the ME set waypoints and allow for CVA alignment if on a carrier.
The frequency does not need to be set to use CAINS/WAYPT as that frequency is
set with jumpers on the actual equipment by the ground crew.</p>
<p>When set to TAC the data link will then receive the 8 target tracks with the
highest priority from the TDS controller. The Link 4A also allows for automatic
carrier landings with the data link set to use the carrier as a host.</p>
<p>To use Link 4C the data link should be set to Link 4C (AUX) and be tuned to a
frequency agreed upon between participating aircraft. Up to four aircraft can
participate within a flight and all four aircraft should have different
addresses set. As the ground crew set the two most significant bits to be the
same for a flight automatically the link can only be used within the same flight
currently.</p>
<p>In Link 4C the participating aircraft shares up to 4 target tracks, selected by
the RIO using the CAP as well as own aircraft position. The CAP also allows the
RIO to update own aircraft INS position to another aircraft on the link to
correlate track transmissions.</p>

<h2 id="anapx-76-iff-interrogator"><a class="header" href="#anapx-76-iff-interrogator">AN/APX-76 IFF Interrogator</a></h2>
<p>The AN/APX-76 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) interrogator is integrated into
the AN/AWG-9 operation. Then interrogator antenna itself is located on the
AN/AWG-9 antenna gimbal platform.</p>
<p>An IFF system works by sending out an interrogation pulse and then listening for
returns from cooperating transponders. In addition to the unencrypted civilian
mode the AN/APX-76 is capable of interrogating in the encrypted military mode 4.
This ensures that targets replying to mode 4 interrogations are indeed friendly.</p>
<p>The AN/APX-76 can be used both in search radar modes and in STT radar modes. To
enable interrogation the IFF switch is depressed on the Detail Data Display
Panel which then activates the interrogator for as long as the button is held up
to 10 seconds max.</p>
<p>When enabled IFF received IFF returns are then overlaid on the normal AN/AWG-9
radar returns on the DDD. A friendly target will be indicated with two bars, one
above and one below the normal radar return. As the AN/APX-76 is a secondary
mode radar (transponder radar) apart from the AWG-9 the IFF can sometimes also
detect targets not detected by the AWG-9. In this case the IFF return will not
have a radar echo inside it.</p>
<p>In the search mode this is overlaid over each target replying and in STT over
the STT target. Additionally, if the STT target is hooked on the TID the DDD
will switch from normal range display to a ±10 NM display to enable display of
multiple returns in case of closely grouped targets.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hydraulics"><a class="header" href="#hydraulics">Hydraulics</a></h1>
<p>The F-14 has two separate hydraulic systems, the flight hydraulic system and the
combined hydraulic system.</p>
<p>Both systems are driven by hydraulic pumps connected to each engine, the flight
hydraulic system from the right engine and the combined hydraulic system from
the left engine. Both systems are pressurized to around 3,000 psi when operating
normally.</p>
<p>Flight control surfaces are supplied by both systems while the combined system
also supplies pressure to secondary systems such as the flaps, landing gear and
the refueling probe. This is so that both systems can drive the control surfaces
independently from each other in case of a failure in the other.</p>
<p>Additionally, the hydraulic systems related to systems not necessary while
airborne can be isolated by a switch next to the landing gear handle. This is so
that damage to those systems won’t affect the combined system pressure and cause
fluid loss. The systems that can be isolated are the landing gear, wheel brakes,
anti-skid and nosewheel steering. This switch is mechanically locked to not
isolating these systems by the landing gear handle when it’s in the down
position.</p>
<p>If only one of the hydraulic pumps fail it’s possible to pressurize that system
from the other pump via the hydraulic transfer pump. This pump is an
omni-directional hydraulically driven pump that can supply either system from
the other and will maintain a pressure between 2,400 and 2,600 psi if the
driving system is at around 3,000 psi. If one system pressure falls below 500
psi the pump will be secured to prevent pump damage and preserve pressure in the
working system. The pump can also be manually disengaged by the pilot.</p>
<p>In case of failure of both hydraulic pumps the flight hydraulic system can be
driven by an electrical pump, called the emergency flight hydraulic pump. This
pump is capable of independently driving the tail control surfaces, enabling the
aircraft to return home and land even without pressure in either main hydraulic
system. The electric pump is automatically enabled if both main systems drop
below 2,100 psi and shut off if either reaches 2,400 psi again. The automatic
pump activation activates the system in the low mode but it can also manually be
selected to either low or high operation. The control surfaces will have a
reduced deflection rate if driven by this pump, more so in low than high.</p>
<p>There is also a hand driven hydraulic pump that can be used to pressurize the
refueling probe and wheel brake accumulator if there’s otherwise no pressure in
the combined system. This is mainly for un-powered ground operation but can be
used as a backup in the air.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-indicators-1"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-indicators-1">Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_hydraulic_hydraulic.jpg" alt="hydraulic" /></p>
<p>The <strong>HYD PRESS</strong>, hydraulic pressure indicator, contains two gauges indicating
<strong>COMB</strong>, combined, and <strong>FLT</strong>, flight system hydraulic pressure in thousands
of psi. The scales have markings for the nominal 3,000 psi pressure when the
pumps are operating normally.</p>
<p>Below the gauges are flags indicating hydraulic pressure availability to the
spoilers <strong>SPOIL</strong> and the operation of the <strong>EMER FLT</strong>, emergency flight
hydraulic pump. The <strong>HI</strong> flag indicates on if the emergency flight hydraulic
pump is operating in high and the <strong>LOW</strong> if it’s operating in low.</p>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_hydraulic_brakepressure.jpg" alt="brake pressure" /></p>
<p>The <strong>BRAKE PRESSURE</strong> gauge shows available pressure in the brake accumulators.
<strong>PARK</strong> indicating parking brake pressure and the <strong>AUX</strong> indicating wheel
brake pressure. The green area represents a pressure from about 2,150 psi to
3,000 psi and the red a pressure below that.</p>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_hydraulic_hydraulictransferpump.jpg" alt="hydraulic transfer pump" /></p>
<p>The <strong>HYD TRANSFER PUMP</strong>, hydraulic transfer pump switch is located on its own
panel on the pilot’s right side console. The switch allows for manual shut-off
of the pump (<strong>SHUTOFF</strong>) but is normally in the <strong>NORMAL</strong> position allowing
the pump to activate automatically if either hydraulic pump fails. The switch is
guarded to the NORMAL position.</p>
<p>The emergency flight hydraulic pump is controlled by a guarded switch on the
Master Test Panel. The guarded position, <strong>(AUTO)LOW</strong> allows the pump to
automatically activate as detailed above and the two other positions, <strong>HIGH</strong>
and <strong>LOW</strong> can manually activate those modes when the guard is up.</p>
<p>On the Caution - Advisory Indicator the only relevant caution light is the <strong>HYD
PRESS</strong> light indicating that either main hydraulic system pressure is below
2,100 psi. It turns off when both systems are again above 2,400 psi.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="environmental-control-system"><a class="header" href="#environmental-control-system">Environmental Control System</a></h1>
<p>The ECS or environmental control system controls and supplies temperature- and
pressure-regulated air to cockpit systems and cooling for electronic equipment
and weapons.</p>
<p>The air used is sourced from the engines, one or both, or if needed from the
emergency ram air door on the fuselage inboard of the right glove.</p>
<p>Systems using ECS air in the cockpit are cockpit pressurization and canopy
seals, anti-g suit inflation, aircrew suit ventilation, seat cushion ventilation
and windshield anti-ice and defogging.</p>
<p>Other systems using ECS air outside of the cockpit are pressurization of
external drop tanks, wing airbag seals, electronics cooling and cooling of the
AN/AWG-9 radar and AIM-54 missiles via an air/liquid heat exchanger.</p>
<h2 id="air-source-and-cockpit-air-controls"><a class="header" href="#air-source-and-cockpit-air-controls">Air Source and Cockpit Air Controls</a></h2>
<p>Air source for the ECS is set using the controls on the Air Conditioning Control
Panel.</p>
<p>The <strong>L ENG</strong> set air source to left engine, <strong>R ENG</strong> to right engine and
<strong>BOTH</strong> to both engines which is also the normal position while in use.</p>
<p><strong>RAM</strong> and <strong>OFF</strong> both enable the emergency ram door but <strong>OFF</strong> turns off
pressurization and heating.</p>
<p>During normal operation temperature in the cockpit is controlled using the
<strong>TEMP</strong> switch and thumbwheel on that same panel. The thumbwheel sets the
temperature which is automatic regardless of airspeed and altitude if the
<strong>TEMP</strong> switch is set to <strong>AUTO</strong>. If that switch is set to <strong>MAN</strong>, manual, it
will vary depending on airspeed and altitude.</p>
<p>The <strong>CABIN PRESS</strong> switch controls the cockpit safety valve, controlling
whether the cockpit is pressurized or not. If set to <strong>NORM</strong> cockpit pressure
is at 8,000 feet up to 23,000 feet and after that 5 psi higher than the
atmosphere outside. <strong>DUMP</strong> depressurizes the cockpit by opening the cockpit
safety valve.</p>
<p>The <strong>RAM AIR</strong> switch is used to modulate cockpit air supply temperature when
the ram air door is in use by opening and closing the emergency ram air door.
This is as in this mode that air is mixed directly with hot bleed air from the
engines. <strong>INCR</strong>, increase, opens the ram door, decreasing temperature and
<strong>DECR</strong> closes the door and increases temperature. spring-loaded to center.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Selection of RAM or OFF inhibits gun firing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current cabin air pressure altitude can be seen on the Cabin Pressure Altimeter
in front of the pilot control stick.</p>
<p>The <strong>CABIN PRESS</strong> caution light is present on the RIO Caution-Advisory Panel,
indicating less than 5 psi absolute pressure or above 27,000 feet cockpit
pressure. On the same panel is also the <strong>COOLING AIR</strong> advisory light which
indicates overheat in the electronics cooling system, indicative of a failure in
the ECS which might damage the electronics.</p>
<p>The anti-g suit pressurization can be tested via the G-valve Button for the
pilot and G-Valve Button for the RIO. The airflow through the suit, or seats if
no suits are worn, are controlled by the <strong>VENT AIRFLOW</strong> thumbwheel on the
pilot Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control Panel and RIO Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control
Panel respectively.</p>
<h2 id="windshield-anti-ice-and-defogging"><a class="header" href="#windshield-anti-ice-and-defogging">Windshield Anti-Ice and Defogging</a></h2>
<p>Windshield anti-ice and defogging is controlled via the External Environmental
Control Panel and Canopy Defog/Cabin Air Lever.</p>
<p>The <strong>WSHLD</strong>, windshield, switch on the external environment panel provides hot
bleed air on the outside of the windshield to clear ice and rain on the glass.
<strong>AIR</strong> enables airflow over windshield, <strong>OFF</strong> disables it.</p>
<p>The Canopy Defog/Cabin Air Lever (for pilot) and Canopy Defog/Cabin Air Lever
(for RIO) sets amount of air through the canopy air diffusers to be used to
defog the canopy. Lever set fully to <strong>CANOPY DEFOG</strong> selects all cockpit air to
be through the canopy diffusers while lever fully at <strong>CABIN AIR</strong> redirects 30%
through the canopy diffusers and the rest to the cockpit diffusers.</p>
<p>The <strong>WSHLD HOT</strong> advisory light on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator
illuminates when the windshield is warmer than 300° F (149° C). This
automatically closes the valve and stops warm air to the windshield until cooled
down.</p>
<h2 id="anawg-9-and-aim-54-cooling"><a class="header" href="#anawg-9-and-aim-54-cooling">AN/AWG-9 and AIM-54 Cooling</a></h2>
<p>The AN/AWG-9 radar and AIM-54 missiles are liquid cooled via independent
liquid/air heat exchangers cooled by ECS air.</p>
<p>The Liquid Cooling Control Panel controls these cooling systems and should be
set to <strong>AWG-9</strong> to enable only the AN/AWG-9 cooler if no AIM-54 Phoenix
missiles are carried. If AIM-54 missiles are loaded <strong>AWG-9/AIM-54</strong> should
instead be set to enable both systems. <strong>OFF</strong> turns off both systems and should
not be set with systems in use as they will overheat.</p>
<p>The RIO Caution-Advisory Panel contains advisory lights for these systems. The
<strong>AWG-9 COND</strong> advisory light indicates overheat in the AN/AWG-9 cooling system,
continuing use of the AN/AWG-9 might damage it. The <strong>MSL COND</strong> advisory light
indicates overheat in the AIM-54 cooling system or operation of the WCS with
AIM-54s loaded and liquid cooling switch not set to <strong>AWG-9/AIM-54</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="external-ecs-air-supply"><a class="header" href="#external-ecs-air-supply">External ECS Air Supply</a></h2>
<p>For operation of systems requiring cooling on the ground or on deck it’s
possible to connect an external ECS air source to cool them.</p>
<p>The normally used source isn’t able to provide cooling for all systems at the
same time though and thus what is to be cooled needs to be set. This is
controlled by the <strong>GND CLG</strong> switch on the IFF Antenna Control/Test Panel panel
at the RIO right side console. <strong>OBC/CABIN</strong> provides the external ECS air to
the cabin and all air cooled electronics. This setting disables the AN/AWG-9
transmitter due to inadequate cooling. <strong>AWG-9/AIM-54</strong> provides the external
ECS air to the AN/AWG-9 and AIM-54 heat exchangers and to related electronics.
<strong>OFF</strong> turns off external ECS air supply and is the normal mode used when the
engines are running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Any setting on the <strong>GND CLG</strong> other than <strong>OFF</strong> should not be used when
the engines are running.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For the Heatblur F-14 in DCS the external ECS air supply is connected via
the same command as the engine starter air.</p>

<h2 id="oxygen-system"><a class="header" href="#oxygen-system">Oxygen System</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 carries one or two 10-liter liquid oxygen bottles providing oxygen to
the crew when needed.</p>
<p>The oxygen supply is controlled on the pilot Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control Panel
and RIO Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control Panel respectively. Both panels contain an
<strong>OXYGEN</strong> switch that sets oxygen supply to <strong>ON</strong> or <strong>OFF</strong>.</p>
<p>Liquid oxygen remaining is shown on the Liquid Oxygen Quantity Indicator on the
pilot’s right side console. The gauge shows remaining liters of liquid oxygen up
to 20 liters (if two bottles are installed). The indicator is electrically
driven and if it receives no power an <strong>OFF</strong> flag will be visible and it will
display 0 liters remaining.</p>
<p>Additionally the RIO Caution-Advisory Panel has the <strong>OXY LOW</strong> caution light
which illuminates when the liquid oxygen quantity is below 2 liters.</p>
<p>During the <strong>INST</strong> test on the MTPanel the liquid oxygen meter shows 2 liters
and the <strong>OXY LOW</strong> caution light illuminates.</p>
<h2 id="canopy"><a class="header" href="#canopy">Canopy</a></h2>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electrical-power-system"><a class="header" href="#electrical-power-system">Electrical Power System</a></h1>
<p>All main electrical power in the F-14 is generated from the two engine driven AC
generators. The generators connected to the gearboxes on the engines are each
capable of generating enough power to individually drive all aircraft systems.</p>
<p>As for DC power generation the F-14 has two transformer-rectifiers supplying 28
V DC, and again each one is individually capable of driving all aircraft DC
appliances.</p>
<p>The F-14 has an external power receptacle for AC power just aft of the nosegear,
capable of driving aircraft AC and DC (through the transformer-rectifiers).
External power is automatically disconnected from the aircraft power system when
one of the internal generators come online.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-power"><a class="header" href="#emergency-power">Emergency Power</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 has an emergency generator driven by the combined hydraulic system
generating a limited supply of AC and DC power. If the system loses main power
the emergency generator takes over supply of flight critical systems within 1
second.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-indicators-2"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-indicators-2">Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_electrical_generator.jpg" alt="generator" /></p>
<p>The controls for the electrical systems are located on the master generator
control panel.</p>
<p>The <strong>MASTER GEN</strong> (<num>1</num>) switches control connection of the main
generators to the electrical buses. The <strong>NORM</strong> position on the switches
connect the individual generators to the buses. The <strong>OFF/RESET</strong> position
disconnects the generator and also resets any protection circuits that might
have cut in because of the power supply being outside normal limits. The
<strong>TEST</strong> position starts the generator but do not connect it to the electrical
buses making it possible to test the generator without affecting other aircraft
systems. The switch is locked to the on position and needs to be lifted to move
it to the OFF/RESET position from NORM.</p>
<p>The <strong>EMERG</strong> (<num>2</num>) switch controls the emergency generator. In the
<strong>NORM</strong> position the emergency generator is automatically connected to the
essential buses if the main generators fail. The <strong>OFF/RESET</strong> position
deactivates the emergency generator and also resets the associated protection
circuits if tripped. The switch is guarded to the NORM position and that guard
needs to be opened to move the switch to OFF/RESET.</p>
<p>Associated caution and advisory lights are located on the pilot Caution -
Advisory Indicator. The <strong>L GEN</strong> and <strong>R GEN</strong> lights, when illuminated,
indicate that the respective generator is not functioning correctly. Either
because of a fault or because the engine driving the generator not running.</p>
<p>The <strong>TRANS/RECT</strong> advisory light indicates that only one or none of the
transformer-rectifiers are functioning.</p>
<p>The emergency generator can be tested by selection of <strong>EMERG GEN</strong> on the
<strong>MASTER TEST</strong> switch on the Master Test Panel. Completion of the test is
indicated by the <strong>GO</strong> light illuminating. In case of a fault the <strong>NO GO</strong>
light illuminates.</p>
<h2 id="circuit-breakers"><a class="header" href="#circuit-breakers">Circuit Breakers</a></h2>
<p>The circuit breakers in the F-14 are located on the pilot’s right and left knee
panels and behind the RIO’s seat on his left and right sides. The breakers
protect aircraft systems from over-current by popping out and isolating the
system drawing too much current. This is indicated by a white line becoming
visible on the breaker as it pops out. The breaker can be reset by pushing it in
and it can also be pulled out manually.</p>
<p>These breakers will be detailed here when implemented in DCS.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lighting-system"><a class="header" href="#lighting-system">Lighting System</a></h1>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat lighting system consists of the internal and the external
lights.</p>
<p>The internal lights are the red instrument panel and console lights, red and
white floodlights and a moveable utility light at both crew stations.</p>
<p>The external lights are the position lights, the anti-collision lights, the
formation lights, the taxi light, the approach lights and the refueling probe
light.</p>
<h2 id="internal-lighting"><a class="header" href="#internal-lighting">Internal Lighting</a></h2>
<p>The red instrument panel and console lights are the normally used lights during
nighttime, they back-light all instruments and controls allowing their use while
impacting night vision minimally.</p>
<p>The floodlights allow for additional lighting of the cockpit panels but care
should be taken to avoid affecting night vision.</p>
<p>The utility lights are movable and can be used to illuminate a specific spot and
as a map or reading light.</p>
<p>Controls for the internal lights are on the Master Light Control Panel in pilot
cockpit and Interior Light Control Panel in the RIO cockpit, each controlling
their own cockpit lighting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The utility light function is not modeled in DCS, but the flashlight
function, default keybind <kbd>LAlt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>, which moves with the
cursor, can be used, providing a similar function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="external-lighting"><a class="header" href="#external-lighting">External Lighting</a></h2>
<p>The position lights on the F-14 are located on the left wing tip (red), right
wing tip (green), top aft of left vertical stabilizer (white) and upper and
lower lights on the wing gloves on each side (red on left glove and green on
right). The glove lights are additional lights supplementing the wing tip
lights. When the wings are swept forward of 25° the wing tip lights are active
and when aft of 25° the glove lights are active instead.</p>
<p>With the gear down, wings forward of 25° and the position lights in steady mode
both the glove and wingtip position lights are lit. When the anti-collision
lights are on the the position lights can only operate in the steady mode,
otherwise they can be set to flash.</p>
<p>The anti-collision lights are located on the chin pod or TCS pod, top front of
the left vertical stabilizer and top aft of the right vertical stabilizer. The
anti-collision lights are all red flashing lights. The chin pod mounted lower
light only operates while the nosegear wheel door is closed.</p>
<p>The formation lights are dim green lights used for formation flight which can be
dimmed gradually. They are located on the aircraft nose (behind the radome), the
wing tips, on the fuselage aft of the wings and on the top edge of the vertical
stabilizers. All are duplicated on both sides of the aircraft.</p>
<p>The taxi light is a fixed headlight located on the nosewheel strut. It’s
automatically turned off with gear retraction if set to on.</p>
<p>The approach lights are also located on the nosewheel strut and replicate the
AoA indexer for the LSOs during carrier traps.</p>
<p>The refueling probe light is used to illuminate the refueling probe and is
automatically enabled with probe extension.</p>
<p>All external light controls are located on the Master Light Control Panel except

<p>The AN/AWG-9 radar in the F-14 is an all-weather, multi-mode pulse doppler radar
using the X-band (X-band being 8-12 GHz). It was designed specifically to be a
long range radar system capable of guiding up to 6 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles using
its track while scan mode. One originally envisioned scenario was its use as a
long range fleet defender intercepting russian bombers and attack aircraft
threatening the fleet. During the F-14’s later service life this mission
transitioned more towards the anti-fighter side, a mission for which it was very
well adapted.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="radar-interface"><a class="header" href="#radar-interface">Radar Interface</a></h1>
<p>The AN/AWG-9 weapons control system (WCS) is an integrated system containing the
F-14’s main sensors and computer providing detection, tracking, and engagement
of targets in the air-to-air and air-to-ground roles.</p>
<h2 id="detail-data-display-ddd-and-panel"><a class="header" href="#detail-data-display-ddd-and-panel">Detail Data Display (DDD) and Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_dddpanel.jpg" alt="DDD Panel" /></p>
<p>The DDD is the main control panel and display for the radar part of the AN/AWG-9
system. It contains all the controls for the radar except the scan volume and
stabilization controls which are on the sensor control panel.</p>
<h3 id="tgts-mlc-agc-and-paramp-switches"><a class="header" href="#tgts-mlc-agc-and-paramp-switches">TGTS, MLC, AGC and PARAMP Switches</a></h3>
<p>The upper left part of the DDD panel contains four switches
(<num>1</num>-<num>4</num>) controlling amplification, main-lobe clutter (MLC)
suppression and target size parameters.</p>
<p>The <strong>TGTS</strong> (targets) switch selects expected target size which is used by the
WCS to calculate missile launch zones and set parameters for target tracking in
the radar. It also sets the range at which the missile ATC is sent, <strong>SMALL</strong>
being 6NM, <strong>NORM</strong> 10NM and <strong>LARGE</strong> 13NM. The selected position of this
switch might negatively affect target tracking and engagement if set
incorrectly.</p>
<p>The <strong>MLC</strong> switch controls how the system suppresses the MLC in the radar
system while in pulse doppler mode. The OUT position disables the system while
the IN position enables it. The AUTO position automatically enables the MLC
filter if the antenna look-up angle is less than 3°.</p>
<p>The <strong>AGC</strong> switch controls the automatic gain control and is used in the pulse
doppler modes to allow control of the time constant used for the AGC. Normally
(NORM position) the AGC uses a longer time constant to calculate a mean value
used for amplification. If the radar is operating in a jammed environment or
heavy clutter is present the AGC can be set to use a faster time constant to
mitigate these factors but this setting can also make the radar less sensitive
to real targets.</p>
<p>The <strong>PARAMP</strong>, parametric amplifier switch allows for manual control of the
parametric amplifier which is used to amplify weaker targets in all radar modes.
Normally the WCS controls when to use the PARAMP depending on range but if
tracking an unusually strong target it can be used to disable PARAMP to lessen
the effect from background noise. If set to off manually it lessens the
detection range by approximately 35%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 AGC and PARAMP switches are currently not implemented.</p>

<h3 id="awg-9-range-selection-and-tracking-indication"><a class="header" href="#awg-9-range-selection-and-tracking-indication">AWG-9 Range Selection and Tracking Indication</a></h3>
<p>In the upper central part of the DDD panel are located the controls and
indicators for setting the radar range in the search modes. Below these are also
present the indicators for radar tracking while in the single target track (STT)
modes.</p>
<p>The six round buttons (<num>8</num>), which are labelled <strong>5, 10, 20, 50, 100</strong>
and <strong>200</strong>, are used to set desired radar range in pulse modes and IFF range,
they also set the scale on the pilot target range displays. The buttons are
mutually exclusive as only one range can be selected at a time. In pulse search
this setting affects the PRF of the radar and the scale on the DDD and if set to
20nm or greater range it also enables pulse compression.</p>
<p>The <strong>range display drum</strong> (<num>7</num>) indicates currently displayed scale on
the DDD for the pulse modes and is blank when using pulse-doppler. It can also
show ±10 for when using the IFF interrogator in the STT modes.</p>
<p>Below these are the four radar track indicator lights which are used to indicate
how the radar tracks the target in STT.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ANT TRK</strong>: Indicates the radar is tracking the target angle (azimuth and
elevation).</li>
<li><strong>RDROT</strong>: Indicates the target is in the range or rate gate.</li>
<li><strong>JAT</strong>: Indicates the antenna is tracking a jamming source’s angle.</li>
<li><strong>IROT</strong>: Indicates target angle tracking via TCS.</li>

<h2 id="radar-and-missile-frequency-selectors"><a class="header" href="#radar-and-missile-frequency-selectors">Radar and Missile Frequency Selectors</a></h2>
<p>The thumbwheels in the upper rightmost part of the DDD panel are used to control
the AN/AWG-9 radar emitter’s frequency (<num>13</num>) and the missile control
channel used with the AIM-7 and AIM-54 (<num>14</num>). Adjustment of these
might be needed to avoid interference from other AN/AWG-9 equipped aircraft or
other external sources. The WCS reads the missile channel for the AIM-7 as the
missiles are prepared as they need to be tuned and changing the channel after
this will not affect a change unless the preparation sequence is restarted.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="radar-mode-selectors"><a class="header" href="#radar-mode-selectors">Radar Mode Selectors</a></h3>
<p>In the lower right part of the DDD panel are located the controls for display
mode and radar mode and its indicator drum. The display mode buttons
(<num>15</num>) selects what mode is currently selected for display on the DDD.
The <strong>RDR</strong>, radar, mode is the normally selected mode. The <strong>IR</strong> mode is
non-functional as the IR system is not installed. The <strong>IFF</strong> button enables the
IFF interrogator in one of its two operational modes, for more detail see the
IFF section in the General design and systems overview chapter.</p>
<p>The radar mode buttons (<num>16</num>) selects the operational mode of the
AN/AWG-9 radar. The two STT buttons, pulse-doppler single target track (<strong>PD
STT</strong>) and pulse single target track (<strong>P STT</strong>), enables selection of an STT
mode if available and relevant. These are used to automatically attempt an STT
lockon onto a hooked TID target or to transfer between these two STT modes. The
pulse doppler search button (<strong>PD SRCH</strong>) selects the PD SEARCH mode of the
radar. The range-while-search button <strong>(RWS</strong>) selects the RWS mode of the
radar. The two track-while-scan buttons (<strong>TWS AUTO</strong> and <strong>TWS MAN</strong>) selects
their respective TWS modes for use in the radar. The pulse search button
(<strong>PULSE SRCH</strong>) selects the pulse search mode of the radar.</p>
<p>The <strong>indicator drum</strong> (<num>17</num>) shows currently selected radar mode.
Apart from TWS MAN, TWS AUTO, RWS which refers to their respective modes it can
also show MRL (manual rapid lockon), A-G (air-to-ground), VSL (vertical scan
lockon), OPTTRK (TCS track), PLM (pilot lockon mode), PULSE (for both pulse
search and pulse STT), PD (for both pulse doppler search and PD STT) and PAL
(pilot automatic lockon mode).</p>
<h3 id="aspect-and-vc-switches"><a class="header" href="#aspect-and-vc-switches">Aspect and Vc Switches</a></h3>
<p>On opposite sides of the DDD itself are located the ASPECT and VC switches. The
<strong>Vc</strong> switch (<num>18</num>) controls the rate scale on the DDD in the pulse
doppler search modes. X-4 sets the scale to 800 knots opening to 4,000 knots
closing, NORM sets the scale to 200 knots opening to 1,000 knots closing and VID
sets the scale to 50 knots opening to 250 knots closing.</p>
<p>The <strong>ASPECT</strong> switch (<num>21</num>) controls two different things depending on
radar mode. In the pulse doppler search modes it controls the rate processing
windows of the radar, NOSE sets 600 knots opening to 1,800 knots closing, BEAM
sets 1,200 knots closing to 1,200 knots opening and TAIL sets 1,800 knots
opening to 600 knots closing. In the short pulse STT modes the switch sets the
system tracking mode to the corresponding echo edge or centroid to counteract
countermeasures like chaff and specific jammer modes.</p>
<h3 id="elevation-indicator"><a class="header" href="#elevation-indicator">Elevation Indicator</a></h3>
<p>The elevation indicator scale, <strong>EL</strong>, (<num>22</num>) is used to indicate the
sensor elevations. The left (<strong>RDR</strong>) needle indicates current actual radar
elevation. This indicator will move with the antenna in the radar search modes.</p>
<p>If the HCU is set to RDR the right (IR/TV/EC) needle indicates the currently set
elevation center of the antenna scan pattern. This is useful in STT as it
enables the RIO to set the antenna elevation center to use when you eventually
revert to search.</p>
<p>If the HCU is set to IR/TV the right needle instead displays current TCS
elevation.</p>
<h3 id="counter-countermeasure-mode-controls"><a class="header" href="#counter-countermeasure-mode-controls">Counter-Countermeasure Mode Controls</a></h3>
<p>In the lower leftmost corner are located the three counter-countermeasure mode

<h3 id="radar-and-ddd-control-knobs"><a class="header" href="#radar-and-ddd-control-knobs">Radar and DDD Control Knobs</a></h3>
<p>Spread out on the DDD panel are eight different knobs controlling differing
functions on the DDD and radar. On the upper left side of the DDD is located the
<strong>PULSE VIDEO</strong> control knob (<num>5</num>) which controls the video intensity
on the DDD for the pulse modes. It affects only the DDD display, not the radar
itself.</p>
<p>On the upper right side of the DDD is located the <strong>BRIGHT</strong> control knob
(<num>9</num>) which adjusts a polarized filter which allows for mechanical
control of the brightness of the DDD, mainly used in low light conditions.</p>
<p>On the lower left side of the DDD is located the <strong>PULSE GAIN</strong> control knob
(<num>20</num>) which controls the radar gain in the pulse modes. This control
affects the gain of the radar directly. Normally left in the detent at the fully
clockwise position which allows the WCS to control it automatically.</p>
<p>On the lower right side of the DDD is located the <strong>ERASE</strong> control knob
(<num>19</num>) which controls the strength of the erase beam on the DDD. The
erase beam is what erases the indications continually on the DDD and thus
affects how long the after-image of the detected targets will remain.</p>
<p>On the left side of the DDD panel are located the PD THRLD (<num>26</num>),
JAM/JET (<num>24</num>) and ACM THRLD (<num>25</num>) control knobs. The
pulse-doppler threshold knobs (<strong>PD THRLD</strong>) controls the threshold at which an
echo is regarded as a contact, displayed on the DDD and tracked on the TID in
RWS and TWS. The <strong>CLEAR</strong> knob controls the clear region threshold (upper half
of the DDD) and the <strong>CLUTTER</strong> knob controls the clutter region (lower half of
the DDD). Normally left in the clockwise NORM detents, letting the WCS
automatically control them.</p>
<p>The <strong>JAM/JET</strong> control knob selects the threshold of what jamming intensity
signal strength is needed to regard an emitter as a jammer and make it indicate
a jammer strobe on the TID. The <strong>ACM THRLD</strong> sets the threshold for what to
regard as a target at ACM ranges. Normally left in the counter-clockwise detent,
letting the WCS automatically control it.</p>

<p>The <strong>DDD</strong> screen itself shows either only radar return data or radar returns
combined with symbology depending on radar mode.</p>
<p>In the pulse search mode the display shows only radar returns and the a visual
representation of the radar sweep and erase sweep. The screen shows range vs
azimuth in this mode. In pulse doppler modes the AGC TRACE is added on the
bottom showing supposed jamming intensity of the detected targets. The screen
shows rate vs azimuth in these modes.</p>
<p>In the two STT modes the display shows, in addition to the return from the
target, the tracking gates (either range or range rate gate), a closing rate
indication on the right side and the attack symbology if in air-to-air mode and
a missile is selected.</p>
<p>In pulse STT the target is displayed at the correct azimuth and range while in
pulse doppler STT the target is shifted to the left side of the display and a
generated target symbol is at the correct azimuth instead. In pulse doppler STT
the AGC TRACE is added as well to give an indication of jamming strength. For
information about the attack symbology see the VDIG section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 AGC TRACE not yet implemented.</p>

<p>When the IFF interrogator is activated it superimposes the IFF information on
top of the normal radar picture if in pulse search. In pulse doppler search the
DDD switches to range vs azimuth at the previously set range scale while the IFF
information is shown and in PD STT, if the target is hooked on the TID the DDD
switches to a ±10 scale centered on the target while the IFF returns are shown.</p>
<h2 id="tactical-information-display-tid-and-associated-controls"><a class="header" href="#tactical-information-display-tid-and-associated-controls">Tactical Information Display (TID) and Associated Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_tid.jpg" alt="TID" /></p>
<p>The TID is the main data display for the WCS. It displays a tactical picture to
the RIO which is used to identify and select targets for the long range weapons
on the F-14 Tomcat. Think of it as a top down map showing the relative
coordinates of all presented tracks and symbols, but without a representation of
the ground/surface features (map). It is also used in secondary roles as a
display for entering data into the WCS, for navigation, for INS alignment and
for the on board checkout, OBC.</p>
<h3 id="tid-display-control-knobs"><a class="header" href="#tid-display-control-knobs">TID Display Control Knobs</a></h3>
<p>On the upper edge of the TID are two display control knobs (<num>2</num> &amp;
</num>4</num>). The left one controls the contrast of the TCS display and the
right one controls the overall brightness of the TID. Both settings will depend
on user preference and ambient lighting.</p>
<h3 id="ins-and-navigational-controls"><a class="header" href="#ins-and-navigational-controls">INS and Navigational Controls</a></h3>
<p>On the upper left corner of the TID is the status display for the INS

<p>To the sides of the TID are located two selector knobs. The one on the left side
(<num>12</num>) controls and selects the INS or AHRS mode to use. It also allows
for INS alignment.</p>
<p>On the right side is the selector knob (<num>6</num>) controlling the source

different waypoints stored in the WCS. MAN position is used only for aircraft
with TARPS mounted.</p>
<p>Adjacent to this selector is a readout drum on the upper right edge of the TID

displayed to the pilot.</p>
<p>Possible steering type shown are: destination (DEST), data link command heading
(D/L), azimuth lead collision steering (LD CLSN), collision steering (CLSN),
lead pursuit steering (LD PURST), pursuit steering (PURST), TACAN radial (TACAN)
and manually set commanded heading (MAN).</p>
<h3 id="tid-data-readout-drum"><a class="header" href="#tid-data-readout-drum">TID Data Readout Drum</a></h3>
<p>Above the TID is located the data readout indicator drum (<num>3</num>). It’s
used to indicate the source of the data displayed on the TID text readouts.
Possible readouts are: the different waypoints in the navigational system (WAY
PT, ST, FIX PT, IP and HB), own aircraft (OWN A/C), first priority target
(TGT 1) and SYMBOL.</p>
<p>Symbol indicates that the readout displays data for a hooked symbol on the TID
which doesn’t have its own indicator text on the drum. The drum can also show a
blank face to indicate the data source as one not having its own indicator text
and which has no symbol on the TID.</p>
<h3 id="track-hold-and-clsn-buttons"><a class="header" href="#track-hold-and-clsn-buttons">TRACK HOLD and CLSN buttons</a></h3>

<p>On the left side is the <strong>TRACK HOLD</strong> button (<num>11</num>) which enables the
track hold function. Normally targets on the TID in TWS mode are retained 14
seconds after last observation. The track hold function extends this two 2
minutes for all tracks. If disabled it reverts to the standard 14 second period,
whereafter the targets will be dropped if no new observations occur.</p>
<p>On the right side is the <strong>CLSN</strong> button (<num>7</num>) enabling collision
steering to currently tracked target or centroid if in TWS. This selection
overrides the current steering information presented to the pilot with the
collision steering, only exception being if the pilot selects the ACM.</p>

<h2 id="navigation-command-and-control-grid-nav-grid"><a class="header" href="#navigation-command-and-control-grid-nav-grid">Navigation Command and Control Grid (NAV GRID)</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_navgrid_navgrid.jpg" alt="NAV GRID" /></p>
<p>The Navigation Command and Control Grid or <strong>NAV GRID</strong> was designed to enable
easy navigation and CAP control from a common fixed reference point. It enables
TID readout of bearing and range from that set reference point, called <strong>YY</strong>.
While NAV GRID is active displayed range and bearing on the TID for hooks and
own aircraft is indicated relative <strong>YY</strong>. Additionally it also displays a grid
extending from YY along a set threat axis. The purpose of the grid itself is to
allow for quick position reference while a precise readout is available for a
hooked target. This is where the name NAV GRID originates.</p>
<p>Lastly it also allows for display of something called <strong>Voice Codes</strong>. These are
displayed for current hook alternating with the altitude readout on the TID if
<strong>ALT NUM</strong> is selected for display. It indicates bearing from <strong>YY</strong> in tens
(15 reading as 150 as an example) followed by a letter indicating range. <strong>A</strong>
would indicate 0-50nm while <strong>B</strong> indicates 50-100nm and so on for consecutive
letters.</p>
<p>The standard NAV GRID display mode is <strong>GND STAB</strong> and this allows for the grid
itself to be visible. If <strong>A/C STAB</strong> or <strong>ATTK</strong> display modes are selected
only the <strong>Voice Code</strong> display functionality is retained but it addition to the
normal functionality the <strong>Ownship Symbol</strong> will always display its <strong>Voice
Code</strong>.</p>
<p>As default the grid origin, <strong>YY</strong>, is positioned at the edge of the TID
extending outwards along the set threat axis. The grid can be set to have
between 1 and 6 sectors display, all being outlined meaning that the one sector
display will have 2 lines delineating the limits and 6 having 7 lines. The size
of the sectors depend on the total grid coverage, which can be up to 180
degrees, which is then divided into the selected number of sectors. Along the
sector demarkation lines are drawn range indicator marks at 50nm intervals, the
50nm marks being shorter than the even 100nm markers.</p>
<p>The ground stab view as well as the grid can be offset as normal by the RIO via
the HCU. To reset the offset, cycle to any aircraft stabilized mode and back to
<strong>GND STAB</strong>.</p>
<p>While the original purpose of this functionality was intended for fleet defence
use it works perfectly fine as a bulls-eye reference in DCS with <strong>YY</strong> set to
the bulls-eye. The only real limitation being the grid only displaying along the
threat axis and not all around.</p>

<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_hcu.jpg" alt="HCU" /></p>
<p>The hand control unit (HCU), stick and corresponding controls are the main input
controlling the RIO WCS displays. It contains the power controls and indicators
for the WCS and TCS in addition to the stick and it’s controls.</p>
<h3 id="hcu-power-controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#hcu-power-controls-and-indicators">HCU Power Controls and Indicators</a></h3>
<p>The lights on the upper edge of the HCU are the IR/TV overtemp indicator
(<num>2</num>), the power reset indicator (<num>4</num>) and the WCS power
indicator (<num>6</num>). The IR/TV power indicator light indicates TCS not
ready when in the standby (STBY) and on positions, will remain on in the standby
position and turn off in the on position when the TCS is ready for operation.
The power reset indicator light indicates that one or more of the secondary
power supplies are inoperative due to a power fault tripping it’s protection
circuit. The WCS power indicator light indicates WCS in standby (STBY) or on but
that the radar is not ready to transmit. During startup the light will turn off
until the radar startup timer times out. To reset radar cycle to standby and
back to on.</p>
<p>The <strong>IR/TV</strong> switch (<num>1</num>) in the upper left corner of the HCU controls
the power to the TCS. Standby (STBY) starts system initiation but does not turn
on the sensor. On enables sensor operation. The switch requires the WCS XMT to
be in STBY or on to be enabled. The <strong>WCS XMT</strong> switch (<num>7</num>) controls
power to the WCS computer system and corresponding displays (DDD and TID) and
inhibits or allows radar transmission. Standby (STBY) enables power to all WCS
systems, including displays, and begins the radar warmup sequence. The displays
requires 30 seconds warmup and the radar requires 3 minutes of warmup for
operation. The on position enable radar transmission if weight on wheels is not
present and radar timeout (warmup) is complete.</p>
<p>The two buttons in the upper middle of the HCU is the <strong>LIGHT TEST</strong>
(<num>3</num>) and <strong>PWR RESET</strong> (<num>5</num>) buttons. The LIGHT TEST button
enables control of all WCS lights and indicators by enabling their lights. The
PWR RESET button resets the protection circuits of the secondary power supplies
re-enabling them, also resets missile power. Should only be used if the power
reset indicator light is on, if the fault tripping the circuits remain the
protection circuits and the indicator light will remain on.</p>
<h3 id="hcu-mode-buttons"><a class="header" href="#hcu-mode-buttons">HCU Mode buttons</a></h3>
<p>The four lighted buttons on the left side (<num>12</num>) of the HCU stick are
the HCU mode buttons which illuminates green to indicate which one is active,
they are mutually exclusive. The <strong>IR/TV</strong> button selects TCS mode, allowing the
HCU stick and controls to control the TCS. The <strong>RDR</strong> button selects radar
mode, allowing the HCU stick and controls to control the radar acquisition
cursor on the DDD allowing for transition from radar search modes to STT. The
<strong>DDD CURSOR</strong> button selects DDD cursor mode, allowing the HCU stick and
controls to control the DDD cursor used to indicate ground coordinates when
using the radar for ground mapping. This is used for radar navigational fixes or
for selecting a position on the DDD radar display for use as a waypoint. The
<strong>TID CURSOR</strong> button selects TID cursor mode, allowing the HCU stick and
controls to control the TID cursor used to hook (select) symbology on the TID
for symbology control and data readout.</p>
<h3 id="hcu-control-stick"><a class="header" href="#hcu-control-stick">HCU Control Stick</a></h3>
<p>The controls on the HCU stick are: the action trigger switch (<num>11</num>),
elevation vernier control (<num>10</num>), the OFFSET button (<num>9</num>) and
the MRL button (<num>8</num>). The action trigger on the forward side of the
stick has two detents, the half-action first detent and the full-action second
detent. <strong>Half-action</strong> enables display of the cursor for the selected mode
except when in TCS mode where it enables stick control of TCS elevation and
azimuth. In the radar mode it additionally enables the super search acquisition
mode in the radar (See chapter about radar transitional modes for more
information). <strong>Full-action</strong>, when enabled tells the TCS to lockon to a target
in the TCS mode if a target is present in its acquisition gates. In the radar
mode it tells the radar to attempt lockon to a target in the radar range/rate
gates at the set azimuth. In the DDD and TID modes it marks the current cursor
position or, in the case of the TID mode, tries to hook a symbol if present
within 0.125 inches on the display.</p>
<p>The <strong>elevation vernier</strong> control is a thumbwheel on the left side of the stick
used in the TCS and radar modes to fine tune sensor elevation ±4° for target
acquisition, this elevation deflection is added to the normal sensor elevation
control. The <strong>OFFSET</strong> button on the top of the stick is used to offset any of
the TID tactical displays, moving the own aircraft symbol to the TID cursor spot
hook (if present) and the rest of the symbology relative to that. This function
is reset and all the symbols are moved to the original positions by cycling the
TID display mode selector to another mode and back. The <strong>MRL</strong> button on the
right side of the stick is used to enable the manual rapid lockon mode (MRL) for
target acquisition. See Manual Rapid Lockon (MRL) for more information.</p>
<p>The <strong>stick</strong> itself functions differently depending on selected HCU mode. In
all cases the stick is only enabled with the action trigger depressed and all
modes control sensor or cursor position absolutely meaning that a given
deflection of the stick always moves the sensor or cursor to the same position.
In the TCS mode X (up/down) controls TCS elevation and Y (left/right) controls
TCS azimuth. In the radar mode X controls the range or rate of the radar
acquisition gate on the DDD and Y controls the gate in azimuth in a similar
fashion. In the two cursor modes X controls up/down of the cursor on the
respective screen and Y controls left/right of the same.</p>
<h3 id="computer-address-panel-cap"><a class="header" href="#computer-address-panel-cap">Computer Address Panel (CAP)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_cap.jpg" alt="CAP" /></p>
<p>The computer address panel (CAP) is the RIO’s main interface for controlling and
entering/reading data into/from the WCS computer.</p>
<h3 id="numeric-keypad-3"><a class="header" href="#numeric-keypad-3">Numeric Keypad (3)</a></h3>
<p>The upper part of the CAP contains a numeric keypad with additional buttons for
clearing input (CLEAR), entering input (ENTER) and two buttons for selecting S/W
and N/E prefixes for coordinates. Some of the number keys has an additional
function selecting a prefix for data display and/or entry. The keys containing
functions and what those are:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: right">Key</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">1</td><td>LAT - Latitude, selects latitude for display and entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">2</td><td>NBR - Number, used for IFT and BITs.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">3</td><td>SPD - Speed, selects speed for display and entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">4</td><td>ALT - Altitude, selects altitude for display and entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">5</td><td>RNG - Range, selects range for display and entry.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="text-align: right">8</td><td>HDG - Heading, selects heading for display and entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0</td><td>BRG - Bearing, selects bearing for display and entry.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Some of these keys also makes a corresponding other data be displayed on the TID
readouts but entry only affects the selected prefix. As an example LAT also
makes the readout display LONG but entry affects LAT only, SPD and HDG are
another example of the same thing.</p>
<h2 id="cap-message-matrix-indicator-drum-and-buttons"><a class="header" href="#cap-message-matrix-indicator-drum-and-buttons">CAP Message Matrix Indicator Drum and buttons</a></h2>
<p>The middle/lower part of the panel contains the message buttons and indicator
drum and its CATEGORY selector knob. Its functionality is somewhat akin to the
buttons on a MFD in a more modern system except that instead of a screen the
drum is used to display the current functionality of the buttons.</p>
<p>The current functionality of the buttons are chosen by selecting a category on
the CATEGORY selector knob, movement of the selector turns the display drum to
indicate selected category’s button functionality. When a function or symbol
hook is in use the corresponding message button illuminates to indicate
activation.</p>
<p>The matrixes and corresponding functionality of the different categories are as
follows:</p>
<h3 id="categories"><a class="header" href="#categories">Categories</a></h3>
<h4 id="bit-built-in-test"><a class="header" href="#bit-built-in-test">BIT (Built in Test)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_capdrum_bit.jpg" alt="BIT" /></p>
<p>The BIT category contains message button functions pertaining to BIT initiation
of different aircraft systems. These might be functions normally run during OBC
during startup or separate tests only available from here. This will be detailed
in a separate chapter about on board tests and BIT when implemented, not
currently implemented in this simulation.</p>
<h4 id="spl-special"><a class="header" href="#spl-special">SPL (Special)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_capdrum_spl.jpg" alt="SPL" /></p>
<p>The SPL category contains various message button functions not contained under
the other categories. Currently only the IP TO TGT function is implemented and
used for the Computer Initial Point air to ground mode, see Computer Initial
Point. It also contains a button for manually initiating the OBC routine (OBC
BIT), a button for displaying latest OBC results (MAINT DISP) and a button for
clearing the latest OBC results (OBC DISPL). These and the other functions are
not yet implemented.</p>
<h4 id="nav-navigation"><a class="header" href="#nav-navigation">NAV (Navigation)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_capdrum_nav.jpg" alt="NAV" /></p>
<p>The NAV category contains message button functions used for navigational fixes
and updating data used by for INS operation and alignment. The OWN A/C (own
aircraft) button selects own aircraft for data readout and entry, the same as
hooking the own aircraft symbol on the TID. Its used to enter data critical for
INS alignment like aircraft coordinates and altitude (and heading and speed if
on a moving carrier) and can also be used for readout of the various data
available about own aircraft. The STORED HDG ALIGN button is used to store and
indicate if a stored heading align is available. It also allows deselection of
the function resulting in a normal alignment. The WIND SPD HDG button selects
entry and display of wind data, can also be used to enter wind speed and heading
manually for backup navigation. The MAG VAR (HDG) button is used to display and
enter magnetic variation used by the navigational system. The four FIX buttons,
TACAN FIX, RDR FIX (radar), VIS FIX (visual) and FIX ENABLE are used to update
aircraft position to correct for INS drift. Basic function is the selection of
type of fix followed by FIX ENABLE to enter it into the system. Full procedures
for these fixes can be found in the navigational section in this chapter. The
two TARPS buttons are non-functional in a non TARPS aircraft.</p>
<h4 id="tac-data-tactical-data"><a class="header" href="#tac-data-tactical-data">TAC DATA (Tactical Data)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_capdrum_tacdata.jpg" alt="TAC DATA" /></p>
<p>The TAC DATA category contains message button functionality allowing for
hook/selection of the different waypoints available in the WCS navigational
system. The same hook can be made via HCU hook on the TID. Hooking the waypoints
enables them to be updated via the CAP keypad. The PT TO PT button is
non-functional.</p>
<h4 id="data-link"><a class="header" href="#data-link">DATA LINK</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_capdrum_dl.jpg" alt="DATA LINK" /></p>
<p>The DATA LINK category contains message button functionality for RIO data link
responses to data link controller commands. The WILCO (will comply), CANTCO (can
not comply) tells the controller if own aircraft can or can not comply to a
command. POINT enables the RIO to mark a hooked track sent to the controller for
special attention. ENGAGE likewise indicates own intention to engage a hooked
track. The NAV GRID button enables the NAV GRID functionality on the TID, see
Navigation Command and Control Grid (NAV GRID). The TID AVIA button enables the
AVIA display on the TID. Not yet implemented. The F/F NAV UPDATE allows for
Link-4C fighter to fighter navigational updates. See the navigation chapter.
Remaining buttons are non-functional.</p>
<h4 id="target-data"><a class="header" href="#target-data">TARGET DATA</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_capdrum_tgtdata.jpg" alt="TARGET DATA" /></p>
<p>The TARGET DATA category contains message button functionality used to modify
hooked track symbols. The FRIEND, UNK (Unknown), HOST (Hostile) and MULT TGT
(Multiple Target) message functions are used to mark a hooked symbol as the
respective category (multiple target can be set in addition to the other three).
The DO NOT ATTK button sets a target as a do not attack target, removing it from
the WCS firing order. The DATA TRANS (Data Transfer) function enables a hooked
jam strobe to be correlated with another hooked track symbol. This is used to
allow the WCS to better use both data sources to track the target. The strobe
needs to be hooked before the symbol. Currently not implemented. TEST TGT (Test
Target) calls up a simulated test target in the WCS for test purposes. Currently
not implemented. The SYM DELETE (Symbol Delete) allows the RIO to manually
drop/remove a track or waypoint from the TID if no longer relevant. Own aircraft
and data link track symbols can not be removed. IFT AUX LAUNCH and GND MAP are
non-functional.</p>
<h3 id="program-restart-button"><a class="header" href="#program-restart-button">Program Restart Button</a></h3>
<p>Below the message readout and buttons are two final buttons on the panel. The
<strong>PRGM RESTRT</strong> (Program Restart) button resets the currently running program in
case of a computer hang-up. A computer hang-up is indicated when the computer
run indicator digits on the TID stops cycling. The last button is the <strong>TUNE

<p>Data readout and entry on the TID always follows the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selection of symbol/function</li>
<li>Prefix selection for display</li>
<li>Data entry</li>
</ol>
<p>Selection of desired symbol or function can be achieved either via <strong>TID hook</strong>
or via the <strong>CAP MESSAGE</strong> buttons available under the different categories on
the <strong>CAP DRUM</strong>.</p>
<p>Most data readout prefixes displays multiple readouts, as an example calling up
either latitude and longitude shows both and calling up range also displays
bearing and vice versa but the selected prefix is the one used for data entry.</p>
<p>To select another prefix for data readout without re-selecting the message
function the <strong>CLEAR</strong> key on the CAP is used, this resets the readout and
allows for selection of a new prefix. As it’s possible that depression of a
prefix button is read as a data entry if a prefix is already selected it’s
normally recommended to reset using <strong>CLEAR</strong> before re-selecting a new prefix.
This makes the recommended sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selection of symbol/function</li>
<li><strong>CLEAR</strong></li>
<li>Prefix</li>
<li>selection for display</li>
<li>Data entry</li>
</ol>
<p>To enter new data into selected prefix the RIO enters desired data after the
prefix selection, checks it is correct and then enters it with the <strong>ENTER</strong>
key. The TID readout is then updated with the new data. To clear the data
without entering it, instead use the <strong>CLEAR</strong> key.</p>
<h2 id="sensor-control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#sensor-control-panel-1">Sensor Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_radarircontrol.jpg" alt="Radar and IR Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The sensor control panel contains the main controls for the AN/AWG-9 radar
antenna scan patterns. It also contains various TCS controls, a control allowing
the RIO to slave the radar to the TCS and vice versa and controls for the
airborne video tape recorder (AVTR).</p>
<h3 id="antenna-search-pattern-selection"><a class="header" href="#antenna-search-pattern-selection">Antenna Search Pattern Selection</a></h3>
<p>The upper half of panel contains controls for the radar antenna scan pattern.
The <strong>STAB</strong> (stabilization) switch controls whether the radar antenna scan
pattern is stabilized relative to the horizon (IN) or not. If in OUT instead
meaning that the scan pattern is relative to the F-14 aircraft armament datum
line (ADL). The WCS computer can override this setting if necessary. The <strong>AZ
CTR</strong> (azimuth control) and <strong>EL CTR</strong> (elevation control) knobs sets the
elevation and azimuth centerpoint of the antenna scan pattern. The <strong>azimuth
control</strong> moves the azimuth scan center within 65° degrees of the aircraft
centerline, this is disabled if azimuth scan width is set to ±65° as it already
scans the whole available azimuth range. Do not move the scan pattern so that it
scans outside of 65° from aircraft centerline as this might damage the antenna
as it might hit the antenna azimuth stops. The <strong>elevation control</strong> moves the
elevation position of the bottom bar of the elevation scan pattern relative to
zero elevation. It can move from -76° to +54°. Both control knobs have marked
centerpoints, being aircraft centerline and zero elevation respectively.</p>
<p>The <strong>AZ SCAN</strong> (azimuth scan) and <strong>EL BARS</strong> (elevation bars) selector knobs
controls the size of the antenna scan pattern. The AZ SCAN selector knob has
four settings, ±10°, ±20°, ±40° and ±65°. The EL BARS selector knob also has
four settings, 1, 2, 4 or 8 bars. 1 bar being 2.3°, 2 bars 3.6°, 4 bars 6.3° and
8 bars 11.5°. The reason for the elevation coverage not equalling one bar times
the number of bars being that the bars overlap slightly.</p>
<p>The last radar control on the panel is the <strong>VSL</strong> switch. Momentary selection
of VSL HIGH or LOW activates the vertical scan lockon acquisition mode (VSL).
(See Vertical Scan Lockon (VSL))</p>
<p>The lower part of the panel contains controls for the airborne video tape
recorder (AVTR) controlling and indicating power mode and time remaining on

<h2 id="pulse-mode"><a class="header" href="#pulse-mode">Pulse Mode</a></h2>
<p>In the pulse mode of operation the AN/AWG-9 does not use pulse doppler filtering
which means that it can be used to detect targets at all aspects and also be
used for rudimentary ground mapping. On the pro side this means that the radar
in this mode cannot be notched as it does not need to have a relative speed to
register the target. The downside however is that the radar does not have an
easy way of differentiate between unwanted ground reflections and real targets
meaning that aircraft can hide in the ground clutter near the ground. Because of
this and the increased difficulty from trying to differentiate real targets from
the general background noise without doppler filtering means that the range in
the pulse modes are less than in the pulse doppler modes.</p>
<p>The radar has two pulse modes, pulse search and pulse single target track
(P-STT).</p>
<h3 id="pulse-search-pulse-srch"><a class="header" href="#pulse-search-pulse-srch">Pulse Search (PULSE SRCH)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_PSEARCH.jpg" alt="Pulse Search" /></p>
<p>Pulse search is used to search for and find airborne targets at range.</p>
<p>It is possible to use this radar mode as a basic ground mapper as well which can
be useful for navigation and navigational fixes and can also be used in a pinch
to detect larger surface targets like ships. Keep in mind though that the radar
is not built with this as its main function and that a real air-to-ground radar
will outperform it handily.</p>
<p>In this mode the radar cannot by itself differentiate targets and generate
tracks meaning that the WCS will not generate track files and display anything
on the TID. This also means that pulse search is not capable of guiding
missiles.</p>
<p>The DDD in this mode will display a radar image indicating the azimuth and range
of targets at selected scale and it is possible to transition to P STT using the
RDR mode with the HCU stick. It is possible to select ground or aircraft
stabilized modes of operation using the STAB switch on the sensor control panel.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-single-target-track-p-stt"><a class="header" href="#pulse-single-target-track-p-stt">Pulse Single Target Track (P-STT)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_PSTT.jpg" alt="Pulse STT" /></p>
<p>Pulse STT is used to track a single target, like pulse search mode it is not
susceptible to notching but it is to ground clutter. The fact that the STT modes
use gates to track the target, in this case range gates, means that it is less
susceptible to ground clutter but a target close enough to the ground that the
ground return enters the range gates would be likely to shake the lock.</p>
<p>As it is only in the pulse doppler modes that the missile guidance commands can
be sent pulse STT is limited to launching AIM-7s in CW mode and AIM-54s in
active launch mode limiting their ranges. At short ranges, ACM ranges, it is
possible to use the ASPECT switch to set what aspect of the target to track,
this is just to counter different types of countermeasures. As an example, if
set to NOSE the radar will be less susceptible to chaff as the radar weights its
track towards the targets leading edge (nose) away from the chaff being launched
behind the target.</p>
<p>A successful track is indicated by the ANT TRK and RDROT indicator lights on the
DDD, meaning that the antenna is tracking the target and that the target is
within the range gates. If the target is jamming with sufficient strength,
negating a range track, the radar will transition to a jam angle track instead,
indicated by the JAT indicator light on the DDD illuminating instead of the
RDROT. When range tracking is again possible at closer ranges the radar will
transition to that instead.</p>
<p>The DDD in this mode will be similar to the pulse search mode but the antenna
will be locked onto the target and not scan. Additionally the DDD will show the
range gates around the target, a closing rate symbol at the right scale and
applicable attack symbology if a valid missile is selected.</p>
<h2 id="pulse-doppler-mode"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-mode">Pulse Doppler Mode</a></h2>
<p>In pulse doppler mode the AN/AWG-9 uses doppler filters to filter out unwanted
returns, enhancing target detection and thus increasing detection range. The
pros of this mode being that, as said, targets can be detected at greater
ranges, ground returns mostly eliminated and missile guidance commands be sent
to AIM-7 and AIM-54 missiles. The AIM-54 both in TWS and STT and the AIM-7 in
STT only. The biggest con of this mode being that it is susceptible to notching
as a target returning zero relative speed will be filtered out.</p>
<p>The pulse doppler modes of the AN/AWG-9 are, pulse doppler search, range while
search, track while scan and pulse doppler STT. The three search modes have a
common DDD display, the main difference being that pulse doppler search has a
slightly better range as the other two modes need to process FM-ranging to
enable range indication of tracked targets.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-search-modes"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-search-modes">Pulse Doppler Search Modes</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_PDSEARCH.jpg" alt="Pulse Doppler Search" /></p>
<p>The DDD in the pulse doppler search modes displays returns at azimuth versus
rate (closing speed) meaning that by reading only the DDD the RIO can only
discern target closing speed and azimuth. The display indicates observed closure
rate vs the ground (with own airspeed subtracted) as opposed to relative closure
rate. While this means that a target directly ahead, moving directly towards the
radar, will show true target airspeed this speed varies with target aspect and
radar antenna azimuth. This reason for this is that the radar itself only reads
relative airspeed which is then modified by subtracting own airspeed for display
on the DDD.</p>
<p>At the bottom edge of the DDD the AGC-trace is displayed indicating radar return
intensity enabling the RIO to discern jamming targets by their return strength.
The jamming targets are shown as jamming strobes on the TID if they exceed the
set jamming threshold (set by the JAM/JET knob on the DDD).</p>
<p>The scale shown on the DDD (what rate region is shown) can be set by the Vc
switch on the DDD panel. X-4 sets the scale to 800 knots opening to 4 000 knots
closing, NORM sets the scale to 200 knots opening to 1 000 knots closing and VID
sets the scale to 50 knots opening to 250 knots closing. The operating range of
the doppler filters can also be configured by the ASPECT switch on the same
panel, NOSE sets 600 knots opening to 1 800 knots closing, BEAM sets 1200 knots
closing to 1200 knots opening and TAIL sets 1 800 knots opening to 600 knots
closing. This allows the RIO to optimize the doppler filters for a known target
closing speed and this affects the whole radar processing unlike the Vc switch
which only affects the DDD.</p>
<p>Because of the way the radar operates the doppler filters it will have two blind
ranges. The main lobe clutter (MLC) region which contains most of the ground
returns, including those returning with zero groundspeed and is 266 knots wide,
centered around own aircraft groundspeed (133 knots slower and 133 knots
faster). This is the reason that the radar can be notched as a target with the
same relative groundspeed as the ground will also be filtered out. This is
however only true for look-down conditions as when the radar antenna looks up
into the sky this filter isn’t necessary and can be turned off. If the MLC
switch on the DDD panel is in AUTO the radar will automatically turn off the MLC
filter if looking more than 3 degrees above the horizon. It can also be turned
off manually by the RIO but if the antenna looks down this can make the displays
unusable in RWS and TWS as all of the ground returns will be sent to the
computer for tracking. In whichever case, with the MLC filter off, the target
cannot notch the AN/AWG-9 if it is above the radar.</p>
<p>The second filter, and second blind spot, of the radar is the zero doppler
filter. This blind area is centered around a closure rate of negative own
groundspeed, meaning a target moving away from own aircraft at the same speed as
own aircraft. This blind area is a hardware limitation as it is a doppler radar
mode it cannot detect targets without a doppler shift. The resulting blind area
is 200 knots wide, meaning that a chased target moving at a speed of within 100
knots (+/-) of own groundspeed will be invisible to the radar. This means that
when chasing a fleeing target it may very well be necessary to use the pulse
modes instead.</p>
<p>Both filters vary with azimuth as own airspeed relative to target varies with
aspect. Relative airspeed from a target at 45° will be less than a target at 0°
as own speed vector will be pointing away from it slightly. This is the reason
for the mainlobe clutter trace presenting a curve on the DDD as the observed
speed of the returning ground returns will vary with azimuth.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_pd.jpg" alt="PD" /></p>
<p>Target groundspeed 900 knots, own airspeed 1200 knots. See table below for
details, line of sight rate is the sum of target and own aircraft relative rate.</p>

situation with the MLC filter disabled the target would still be visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, all pulse doppler search modes use ground stabilization
exclusively and thus the STAB switch is inoperative.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-search-pd-srch"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-search-pd-srch">Pulse Doppler Search (PD SRCH)</a></h3>
<p>The pulse doppler search mode is used mainly as a kind of early warning mode. It
is the search mode with the greatest detection range but it can display no range
to the RIO, only closure rate. For this reason, the TID can display no track
information.</p>
<h3 id="range-while-search-rws"><a class="header" href="#range-while-search-rws">Range While Search (RWS)</a></h3>
<p>In range while search a frequency measuring ranging mode is added (FM ranging)
to allow the radar to measure range of tracked targets in addition to closure
rate. This additional processing does however mean that the effective range of
the radar is somewhat lesser. The display on the DDD is the same as in pulse
doppler search, the TID however also shows tracks in this mode showing the
targets as tracks momentarily as they’re scanned and displaying their position
and altitude. The targets are shown for a maximum of two seconds or until the
antenna again scans the same bar at the same azimuth at which time it is removed
unless detected again. Maximum number of concurrently shown tracks are 48.</p>
<h3 id="track-while-scan-tws"><a class="header" href="#track-while-scan-tws">Track While Scan (TWS)</a></h3>
<p>The track while scan mode uses the same FM ranging as RWS with the same
reduction in range compared to pulse doppler search and the DDD display is also
the same. The main difference that the computer establishes track files and
tracks up to 24 targets concurrently of which 18 can be shown on the TID at any
given time.</p>
<p>As the computer routine calculating these tracks need a set track refresh time
of 2 seconds this limits available azimuth scan area and bar settings to either
20° 4 bars or 40° 2 bars. When entering TWS the computer automatically selects
the ±20° 4 bar scan disregarding the RIO set scan volumes unless those are set
to ±40° 2 bars in which case that is used instead.</p>
<p>The TWS mode is also the only mode enabling guidance of the AIM-54 at multiple
targets (up to six), and as soon as engageable targets are detected the computer
starts assigning them a missile priority number according to optimal missile
firing sequence.</p>
<p>The TWS has two sub-modes available, TWS Auto (TWS AUTO) and TWS Manual (TWS
MAN), which one is used is selected by the RIO with the corresponding button on
the DDD panel. What differs between the two is that in TWS auto the computer
takes control of used scan volume and scan pattern azimuth and elevation as soon
as target tracks are present. The WCS computer automatically tries to optimize
the scan volume and direction so that tracking of the prioritized targets is
maximized. If not selected before launch the WCS overrides as soon as the first
AIM-54 is launched and selects TWS Auto.</p>
<p>In TWS the pilot is guided to the computed centroid of the tracked targets via
the navigational cues and this centroid is also displayed on the TID as a small
x-shaped cross.</p>
<p>For additional information about TWS symbology and missile guidance see TWS and
TID Symbology.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-single-target-track-pd-stt"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-single-target-track-pd-stt">Pulse Doppler Single Target Track (PD-STT)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_PDSTT.jpg" alt="Pulse Doppler STT" /></p>
<p>The pulse doppler STT works and looks much like the pulse STT mode. It does
however have the same advantages and disadvantages compared to pulse STT as the
other pulse doppler modes compared to the pulse modes. This means that while
much better at tracking a target close to the ground it is however vulnerable to
notching.</p>
<p>The DDD display for pulse doppler STT looks like pulse STT display except that
the target return and antenna azimuth display is moved to the left side of the
screen and a generated synthetic target marker is displayed at the correct
azimuth instead. This is so that the targets range can be displayed by the
synthetic target unlike the other pulse doppler modes which only shows closure
rate. The other symbology on the DDD in this mode are the same as in pulse STT.</p>
<p>Unlike in pulse STT however the AN/AWG-9 can send missile guidance commands in
pulse doppler STT enabling launch of AIM-7 and AIM-54 in pulse doppler mode.
This is the mode with the greatest launch ranges for those missiles with the
disadvantage, in the case of the AIM-54, of only being able to engage one target
at a time.</p>
<h2 id="hcu-stick-in-radar-mode"><a class="header" href="#hcu-stick-in-radar-mode">HCU Stick in Radar Mode</a></h2>
<p>When using the AN/AWG-9 radar in the different search modes it’s possible to
manually use the HCU stick with radar mode selected to select a target on the
DDD for STT lock.</p>
<p>Pressing the HCU trigger to half-action while in radar mode displays the
acquisition gates on the DDD and enables the supersearch mode in the radar. In
supersearch mode the antenna does a ±10° search pattern at the selected amount
of bars around the acquisition gates.</p>
<p>The acquisition gates can then be steered over the detected position of the
target with the HCU, left/right used to steer azimuth and up/down used to steer
range or rate depending on if pulse or pulse doppler is used. The antenna
elevation is then fine-tuned using the elevation vernier on the HCU until the
target return is visible within the acquisition gates. At that time the RIO can
then select full-action on the HCU trigger, commanding the radar to attempt a
lockon at the commanded azimuth, range/rate and elevation.</p>
<p>If successfully executed the radar then transitions into the respective STT mode
and the correct indicators on the DDD illuminates. Pulse STT is used if
transitioning from pulse search and pulse doppler STT if transitioning from any
of the pulse doppler search modes.</p>
<h2 id="transitional-modes"><a class="header" href="#transitional-modes">Transitional Modes</a></h2>
<p>The transitional modes are the ones used to transition into the single target
tracks from the search modes, ACM modes, via TCS or between the two STT modes.</p>
<h3 id="transition-between-the-two-stt-modes"><a class="header" href="#transition-between-the-two-stt-modes">Transition Between the Two STT Modes</a></h3>
<p>If necessary it is possible to transition between pulse STT and pulse doppler
STT by pressing the corresponding button. If the transition fails the radar
reverts to the respective search mode of the commanded STT mode (pulse search if
pulse STT was selected and vice versa).</p>
<h3 id="transition-back-to-search"><a class="header" href="#transition-back-to-search">Transition Back to Search</a></h3>
<p>If the RIO wishes to transition back to a search mode he commands half-action
and releases it causing the radar to return to pulse search if in pulse STT and
pulse doppler search if in pulse doppler STT.</p>
<p>If the radar loses target lock in STT and cannot reacquire it reverts to the
respective search mode as when the RIO transitions manually via half-action.</p>
<p>VSL and MRL can also be reset and returned to search the same way but PLM being
prioritized means that the only way to deselect PLM is either target lockon and
transition to pulse STT or the pilot selecting the PLM button again telling the
radar to return to pulse search.</p>
<h2 id="tws-stt-acquisition"><a class="header" href="#tws-stt-acquisition">TWS STT Acquisition</a></h2>
<p>In TWS it is possible to attempt an STT lockon by hooking a track on the TID and
then selecting either pulse STT or pulse doppler STT on the DDD panel. The WCS
computer then commands the antenna in supersearch to the hooked tracks azimuth,
range/rate and elevation and attempts a lockon if a target is detected.</p>
<p>Unlike in a manual HCU acquisition this process is completely automated but its
success rate is also less than a manual transition.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="acm-modes"><a class="header" href="#acm-modes">ACM Modes</a></h1>
<p>The AN/AWG-9 has three distinct ACM acquisition modes. Pilot lockon mode (PLM),
vertical scan lockon (VSL) and manual rapid lockon (MRL).</p>
<p>The ACM modes are listed in priority order, the different modes overriding other
modes lower in the prioritization. This means that PLM always overrides VSL and
lower modes and VSL overrides PAL and lower modes but not PLM and so on.</p>
<p>All of the modes can be exited by the RIO selecting half-action and release on
the HCU except PLM which will be in effect until the pilot releases the PLM
button.</p>

<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_plm.jpg" alt="PLM" /></p>
<p>The PLM is the ACM mode with the highest priority, it always overrides any other
radar mode and is enabled when the pilot presses the PLM button on the front of
the right throttle. Depression of that button commands the antenna to the
armament datum line (ADL) and causes it to lock onto the first target seen out
to 5 NM.</p>
<p>Thus the procedure to use PLM is for the pilot to fly the ADL marker on the HUD
over the target and then press and hold the PLM button until lockon occurs. The
PLM continues until a target is detected and transition to pulse STT occurs or
the PLM button is released making the radar transition to pulse search instead.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-scan-lockon-vsl"><a class="header" href="#vertical-scan-lockon-vsl">Vertical Scan Lockon (VSL)</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_vsl.jpg" alt="VSL" /></p>
<p>The VSL mode is enabled by the pilot or the RIO and is used to acquire a target
at own aircraft's current heading from an elevation of -15° to +55°. The RIO can
use the VSL switch on the sensor control panel in the RIO cockpit. Two sub-modes
are available by placing the switch into either VSL HI (high) or VSL LO (low)
and releasing it back to center. The pilot can enable VSL HI or LO by selecting
UP or DN respectively on the target designate switch when not in A/G mode.</p>
<p>This commands the antenna to start a volume 5° wide in a circular fashion. If
VSL HI is commanded the vertical area covered is from +15° to +55° and if VSL LO
is commanded the area covered is from -15° to +25°. VSL is indicated on the HUD
by the diamond moving with antenna line of sight indicating its current
position.</p>
<p>When a target is detected within 5 NM the radar transitions into pulse STT,
otherwise it continues in VSL until another mode is selected.</p>
<h2 id="pilot-automatic-lockon-pal"><a class="header" href="#pilot-automatic-lockon-pal">Pilot Automatic Lockon (PAL)</a></h2>
<p>PAL is enabled by the pilot selecting DES on the target designate switch when
not in A/G mode.</p>
<p>PAL commands the antenna to an 8-bar ±20° scan pattern locking onto the first
target detected out to 15 NM. This mode is indicated by the diamond on the HUD
following current antenna line of sight.</p>
<h2 id="manual-rapid-lockon-mrl"><a class="header" href="#manual-rapid-lockon-mrl">Manual Rapid Lockon (MRL)</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/general_awg-9_mrl.jpg" alt="MRL" /></p>
<p>The manual rapid lockon (MRL) mode allows the RIO to quickly acquire a target
within the antenna limits out to 5 NM. When the MRL button on the right side of
the HCU stick is depressed it commands the radar to start a one-bar supersearch
pattern out to 5 NM.</p>
<p>The HCU stick controls the supersearch pattern in azimuth and elevation
(left/right controlling azimuth and up/down controlling elevation). The DDD
displays a normal supersearch pattern in 5 NM scale and additionally two tick
marks are shown at the edge of the scan pattern indicating current elevation.</p>
<p>When the target is visible the RIO commands full-action to acquire the target
and transfer to pulse STT. If only half-action is commanded after entering into
MRL and then released the radar transfers back to pulse search.</p>

<p>The television camera set, or TCS, was constructed as a replacement for the IRST
which was present in the first F-14As produced. When the IRST was found to have
insufficient capability it was decided to replace it with the TCS giving the
F-14 a long range visual identification capability.</p>
<p>The TCS is located underneath and behind the radar radome, just in front of the
nose gear well. It contains an aircraft stabilized high resolution (for its
time) closed circuit television camera. The sensor has two fields of view (FOV),
narrow (NFOV) which is 0.44° or 10X magnification and wide (WFOV) which is 1.42°
or 4X magnification. The gimbal limits are +/- 15° except upwards which is
limited to +11° and the TCS is capable of independent contrast lock or being
slaved to the AN/AWG-9 radar.</p>
<p>The TCS is controlled by the RIO using the sensor control panel, DDD, TID and
the HCU. Video from the sensor can be displayed on the TID and the VDI in the
front seat. Also, the video can be recorded using the airborne video tape
recorder for later review. (Not currently implemented in DCS.)</p>
<h2 id="controls"><a class="header" href="#controls">Controls</a></h2>
<p>The controls for the TCS are located in the RIO cockpit at the sensor control
panel, the DDD and the HCU/TID. The pilot display control panel contains a
switch allowing display of TCS video on the VDI.</p>
<h3 id="sensor-control-panel-2"><a class="header" href="#sensor-control-panel-2">Sensor Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_tcs_scp.jpg" alt="Sensor Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The controls on the sensor control panel for the TCS are; the TCS trim knobs,
the SLAVE switch, the field of view, FOV, switch and the acquire, ACQ, switch.</p>
<p>The <strong>TCS TRIM</strong> knobs controls TCS sensor line of sight, LOS, calibration
relative the AN/AWG-9 radar LOS. If needed these can be used to trim the TCS so
that the two sensors LOS correlate. They have a ±2° range of motion and the
easiest way to check and calibrate the TCS is to lock up a friendly target in
STT and adjust the knobs until the TCS LOS is correctly aimed at the locked
target.</p>
<p>The <strong>SLAVE</strong> switch controls which sensor is controlled by the other. If set to
<strong>RDR</strong> the radar is slaved to the TCS as long as an optical track exists. If
set to <strong>INDEP</strong> each sensor operates independently of the other. And if set to
<strong>TCS</strong> the TCS is slaved to radar LOS as long as an STT track exists.</p>
<p>The <strong>FOV</strong>, field of view switch controls what FOV is used in the TCS. <strong>WIDE</strong>
sets the 1.42°, 4X magnification FOV and <strong>NAR</strong> sets the narrow 0.44°, 10X
magnification FOV.</p>
<p>Lastly the <strong>ACQ</strong>, acquire switch controls the acquisition mode in use in the
TCS. <strong>AUTO SRCH</strong> enables an automatic acquisition mode with a search pattern,
enabling acquisition of the closest target even if outside current FOV. <strong>MAN</strong>
selects purely manual acquisition with the HCU where the target needs to be
pointed at directly. <strong>AUTO</strong> sets an automatic acquisition mode without a
search pattern making the TCS snap to a target as long as it’s inside the TCS
FOV.</p>
<h4 id="tcs-controls"><a class="header" href="#tcs-controls">TCS Controls</a></h4>
<p>The <strong>TCS TRIM</strong> knobs controls TCS calibration in azimuth (AZ) and elevation
(EL). This is used to calibrate the TCS line of sight to be equal to the radar
line of sight. Normally this is done by locking a target in STT, setting slave
to TCS and then fine-tuning the calibration knobs until the TCS looks directly
at the locked target.</p>
<p>The last two switches controlling the TCS are the ACQ (acquisition) and FOV
(field of view) switches. The <strong>ACQ</strong> switch controls how the TCS locks onto
targets. AUTO SRCH means the TCS will move by itself in a limited search pattern
trying to find a target. MAN (manual) means the TCS only locks onto targets if
commanded to by the HCU in TCS mode and AUTO means the TCS automatically tries
to lock onto targets entering its field of view. The <strong>FOV</strong> switch sets whether
the WIDE or NAR (narrow) field of view is used by the TCS.</p>
<h3 id="ddd"><a class="header" href="#ddd">DDD</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_tcs_tcsddd.jpg" alt="DDD" /></p>
<p>The DDD contains two indicators pertaining to the TCS.</p>
<p>The <strong>DDD EL</strong> meter shows current elevation of the TCS sensor LOS as long as
the IR/TV mode is selected on the HCU.</p>
<p>The <strong>IROT</strong> light indicates the presence of a TCS track. The IROT acronym is
inherited from the IRST which the TCS replaced.</p>
<h3 id="hcutid"><a class="header" href="#hcutid">HCU/TID</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_tcs_hcu.jpg" alt="HCU/TID" /></p>
<p>The HCU contains the power switch and indicator for the TCS as well as a button
enabling selection for using the HCU to control the TCS while the TID itself has
a control knob enabling display of the TCS video on the TID as well as a
brightness and contrast control for the video on the TID.</p>
<p>The <strong>IR/TV power</strong> switch is located on the top left corner on the HCU panel
and controls power to the TCS. <strong>OFF</strong> disables all power to the TCS. <strong>STBY</strong>
enables power to the cooling fans and heaters in the TCS. <strong>IR/TV</strong> supplies
power to all systems in the TCS, allow 1-2 minutes for the TCS to spin up and
deliver video. TCS symbology on the TID on the other hand will be available
directly. There is also no need to select the STBY position first, setting the
switch to IR/TV directly works fine.</p>
<p>The indication light next to the power switch indicates a TCS over temperature
condition is lit. If present the TCS should be powered off to prevent damage to
the system.</p>
<p>The <strong>IR/TV</strong> button next to the HCU stick enables HCU stick control of the TCS
sensor, half-action to manually control sensor LOS and full-action to command
target acquisition.</p>
<p>On the TID display control the <strong>TID MODE</strong> switch set to <strong>TV</strong> enables display
of the TCS video on the TID. Note that this disables the TID repeat on the HSD.</p>
<p>Finally the <strong>CONTRAST</strong> and <strong>BRIGHTNESS</strong> knobs on the upper part of the TID
can be used to control the TCS video shown on the TID.</p>
<h2 id="symbology"><a class="header" href="#symbology">Symbology</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/general_tcs_symbology.jpg" alt="Symbology" /></p>
<p>On the TID in non TV mode a TCS track is indicated by a 1.5” strobe at TCS LOS
azimuth with a hollow circle at the end.</p>
<p>The symbology on the video feed from the TCS has indicators for the FOV and two
crosshairs indicating TCS LOS relative own aircraft, <strong>GACH</strong>, and AN/AWG-9
radar LOS relative TCS LOS, <strong>RACH</strong>. Additionally the track window is indicated
by 4 small squares representing each corner of that window.</p>
<p>The field of view lines are shown when in the wide FOV indicating the size of
the area visible when switching to the narrow FOV. They consist of two parallel
lines together creating the sides of an imaginary box indicating the narrow FOV
size.</p>
<p>The gimbal angle crosshairs or <strong>GACH</strong>, which is a solid cross, indicate
deflection of the TCS LOS from the aircraft datum line, ADL. GACH crosshair in
center indicates TCS LOS along ADL and deflection towards the edges indicate
deflection towards the gimbal limits with the video edges being maximum
deflection.</p>
<p><strong>RACH</strong> or radar angle crosshairs, a dashed crosshair, indicate radar antenna
LOS when inside the current TCS FOV. When the sensors are slaved to one another
RACH and GACH will coincide creating a single solid crosshair.</p>
<p>The track window indicates the area that the TCS contrast tracker is currently
locked on to if it has acquired a target. When not in an active track these
squares collapse into the center of the display being 2% of the screen width
when in manual mode and 5% when in an auto mode.</p>
<h2 id="tcs-operation"><a class="header" href="#tcs-operation">TCS Operation</a></h2>
<p>All acquisition modes of the TCS have in common that they can be controlled
using the HCU in IR/TV mode. Selection of the IR/TV button on the HCU enables
this mode and also sets the DDD EL meter (right indicator) to show current TCS
sensor LOS elevation. Half-action enables the HCU to directly control the LOS of
the TCS and full-action commands target acquisition using the selected
acquisition mode.</p>
<p>For manual, <strong>MAN</strong>, TCS acquisition mode this means that the HCU must be used
in half-action to position the tracking window indication over the target and
then selecting full-action. If successfully acquired the track window will then
expand to encompass the target and tracking will begin.</p>
<p>In automatic, <strong>AUTO</strong> acquisition mode half-action works the same but when
selecting full-action for acquisition the TCS will instead automatically try to
lock on to the target closest to the center in the current FOV. Automatic
search, <strong>AUTO SRCH</strong> mode further enhances this by enabling a search pattern
around the commanded FOV (by moving the sensor LOS) acquiring the first found
target.</p>
<p>When using the TCS slave to radar option the two auto modes will automatically
try to lock on to the STT target as soon as it exists and the TCS has been
slewed to that target, enabling a fully automatic track of a target locked in
STT. Additionally, as soon as a track is acquired from an STT lock the TCS will
compare its own LOS to the radar LOS to check if the correct target has been
locked, if the two LOS differ by more than a couple of degrees during a 3-second
window a new acquisition will be attempted. The manual mode will also slave to
radar LOS but will not lock on, instead just following the radar LOS.</p>
<p>To unlock a tracked target when not being slaved to radar, select half-action
and release.</p>
<p>For information about RDR slaved to TCS check the relevant AN/AWG-9 section.</p>
<h3 id="tcs-slave-radar-acquisition"><a class="header" href="#tcs-slave-radar-acquisition">TCS Slave Radar Acquisition</a></h3>
<p>The TCS can be used to track a target in angle while still using the radar for
range and rate. When selecting the radar to be slaved to the TCS line of sight
via the sensor control panel (SLAVE in the RDR position) the radar will still be
active but pointing in the direction of the TCS line of sight while the TCS has
an active track instead of scanning.</p>
<p>From this state it is possible to command half-action and then position the
acquisition gates at the target video and then command full-action. This will
result in either pulse doppler slaved or pulse slaved mode depending on previous
radar mode. It is also possible to switch using the P STT and PD STT button on
the DDD panel.</p>
<p>The resulting sub-mode entered is equivalent to an STT mode where the TCS is
instead used to track the target's angle rather than the radar itself. The radar
is still used to track range and rate, on the DDD the IROT lights instead of the
ANT ROT, IROT relating to IR tracking which has been replaced by the TCS in the
modeled F-14 versions.</p>
<p>This mode can be used to guide missiles, active and CW modes if in pulse and in
PD if in pulse doppler. If the SLAVE switch is set to INDEP from this mode the
system reverts to true pulse STT or pulse doppler STT depending on current mode.</p>

<p><img src="systems/lantirn/../../img/general_lantirn_lantirn.jpg" alt="LANTIRN" /> <em>U.S. Navy photo by
Photographer’s Mate 2nd Class Felix Garza Jr. (030325-N-4142G-009)</em></p>
<p>The LANTIRN or Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night began
life as combined targeting and navigation pods designed for the F-15E and F-16.
When the US Navy became interested in using the F-14 Tomcat in the A/G role
Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) began its own program to show that the
LANTIRN could quickly be adapted for F-14 use.</p>
<p>As the pod was adapted for the F-14 the secondary navigational pod was deleted,
keeping only the targeting pod. The pod was wired up to its own control panel as
the F-14 didn’t have the required 1553-bus for complete integration. The control
panel was patched into the TCS to TID video feed allowing it to select either
the TCS or the LANTIRN for display on the TID and VDI.</p>
<p>While the pod can read waypoints and selected weapon from the WCS, the pod has
its own GPS receiver and is otherwise self-contained and controlled only via its
own control panel. Additionally, it also has its own weapons release guidance
removing the need to boresight the pod to the aircraft, a time-consuming task.</p>
<p>The FLIR sensor itself has three different zoom levels or fields of view (FoV).
The Wide FoV limits are 5.9° and allows a maximum slew rate of 8.5°/s. The
Narrow FoV limits are 1.7° and allows a maximum slew rate of 1.8°/s. The last
mode, the Expanded FoV is a digital zoom of the Narrow FoV, meaning that the
resolution will be worse in this mode. The FoV limits for the Expanded FoV are
0.8° with a max slew rate of 0.7°/s.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-displays"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-displays">Controls and Displays</a></h2>
<p>All the controls for the LANTIRN are situated on its own control panel mounted
on the RIO’s left side console when the pod is present, including the switch
controlling what video feed the TID and VDI display in the TV mode.</p>
<h3 id="lantirn-video-elements"><a class="header" href="#lantirn-video-elements">LANTIRN Video Elements</a></h3>
<p>The FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed) video-feed from the LANTIRN has superimposed
data readout for the crew’s use. This video-feed can be viewed both on the TID
(in TV-mode) and on the VDI (also in TV-mode) when the FLIR feed is selected on
the control panel.</p>
<p>Amongst other things the displays show own aircraft position, target position as
well as targeting cues to the crew. When using the LANTIRN for A/G attack these
readouts are also used as targeting and release cues.</p>
<p><img src="systems/lantirn/../../img/general_lantirn_FLIR.jpg" alt="FLIR" /></p>
<p>Own aircraft data is shown in the upper left corner (<num>1</num>), showing
position, altitude, groundspeed and pitch angle (dive).</p>
<p>On the left side (<num>2</num>) the pod displays whether it’s using white hot or
black hot (WHOT and BHOT) as well as if the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) or MGC
(Manual Gain Control) is in use.</p>
<p>The lower left data-block (<num>3</num>) shows pod information, SR is slant
range (line of sight range), AZ and EL is pod line of sight azimuth and
elevation relative aircraft ADL (with AZ having L or R for left or right of
aircraft heading). Below that is current UTC time and then IBIT codes below
that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 IBIT codes are not implemented currently and the clock will show local
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lower middle (<num>4</num>) shows current pod mode (A/A or A/G) and track
mode (AREA, POINT or Q designations) on the left side. The right side shows
currently selected weapon and laser code while above and in the center an L is
shown when the laser is armed and flashing when firing the laser.</p>
<p>The lower right (<num>5</num>) shows data for currently selected Q (slew-point)
except for QSNO, QADL and QHUD, TTG being time to go until on top of currently
selected Q, the rows below that, bearing and range to Q, ELEV indicating
elevation in feet of Q and lastly, below that, Q location.</p>
<p><num>6</num> is the crosshairs showing tracked position, in this case we have a
bounding box, indicating currently tracked target in point mode. The two widest
zoom modes will have boxes showing the field of view for the next, narrower,
mode. Additionally there’s a small white square (FLIR pointing cue) moving
around showing the current pod line of sight relative to aircraft from a top
down perspective. In this case it’s right next to the upside down ^, top center,
indicating that the pod is looking ahead of the aircraft. If the square is
centered the pod is looking straight down and below center it indicates the pod
looking aft.</p>
<p>Finally, <num>7</num> is the steering guidance towards the selected Q, the top
one being commanded heading and the vertical one on the right the bomb release
cue.</p>
<p>The commanded heading shows current aircraft heading above the inverted ^, with
the commanded heading being displayed as a relative bearing either L (Left) or R
(Right) of current aircraft heading below the line. The commanded heading is
also indicated by a vertical line bisecting the horizontal one.</p>
<p>The right, bomb release cue, is only shown if the selected Q is QDES and shows a
vertical line along which a release cue travels downwards. This release cue is
only visible with a valid weapon selection (bomb) and when it reaches the two
tick marks, that’s the cue to release. Below the line is the indicated TREL
(Time to Release) in seconds, changing to TIMP (Time to Impact) after release.</p>
<p>Around this all is the masking curve, indicating at what angles the pod will be
masked by own aircraft (looking into the aircraft hull). This is relative to the
FLIR pointing cue, when the cue moves outside the masking curve the sensor will
be blocked by the hull.</p>
<h3 id="control-panel"><a class="header" href="#control-panel">Control Panel</a></h3>
<p>The control panel contains all the controls for the pod, including the control
stick.</p>
<p><img src="systems/lantirn/../../img/general_lantirn_panel.jpg" alt="Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The power switch for the LANTIRN pod is located top left (<num>1</num>) with
<strong>OFF</strong> disabling power to the system, <strong>IMU</strong> (blocked in above image) powering
only the LANTIRN IMU and <strong>POD</strong> powering the whole system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 IMU selection has no current DCS function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>MODE</strong> switch (<num>2</num>) switches the POD sensor between <strong>STBY</strong>
(Standby) and <strong>OPER</strong> (Operational).</p>
<p>The <strong>LASER ARMED</strong> (<num>3</num>) light illuminates when the laser is armed
while the <strong>LASER</strong> switch (<num>4</num>) arms it. (ARM and SAFE positions
available.)</p>
<p>Down right is the <strong>VIDEO</strong> switch (<num>5</num>) which controls what video is
fed to the TID and VDI, FLIR selecting LANTIRN FLIR video and TCS selecting TCS
video.</p>
<p>The four grouped indicator lights (<num>6</num>) indicate various error states
in the LANTIRN system and the <strong>IBIT</strong> button (<num>7</num>) initiates the IBIT
(Initialized Built-In-Test).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The IBIT and fault indicators are not currently implemented in DCS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="control-stick-1"><a class="header" href="#control-stick-1">Control Stick</a></h3>
<p>The control stick for the LANTIRN operates the LANTIRN’s sensor itself, note
though that the stick itself does not move, the buttons and hats on the stick
are used to control the pod.</p>
<p><img src="systems/lantirn/../../img/general_lantirn_stick.jpg" alt="Control Stick" /></p>
<p>The left four-way hat, S3, (<num>1</num>) allows selection of QWp- and QWp+
(left/right) in addition to Point Track (up) and Area Track (down) modes.</p>
<p>The center slew hat (<num>2</num>) is used to slew the sensor line of sight
itself and depression of this hat switches between white hot (WHOT) and black
hot (BHOT) sensor modes.</p>
<p>The right four-way hat, S4, (<num>3</num>) allows for selection of QADL/QHUD
(up), QDES (right) and QSNO (down) in addition to declutter level which is
cycled by momentary depression of the hat. The left slider additionally changes
the right hat function as detailed further down.</p>
<p>The red button on top (<num>4</num>) is used to cycle between the three fields
of view (zoom levels) of the IR sensor.</p>
<p>The two-way hat on the side (<num>5</num>) selects either the A/G or A/A modes
of operation for the pod.</p>
<p>Located on the left side of the stick head is a two way slider (<num>6</num>),
spring-loaded to return to center. This switch changes the function of the right
four-way hat.</p>
<p>Sliding it forwards allows for selection of manual gain while releasing and
sliding it forwards again re-selects automatic gain. Change of the manual gain
with manual gain already selected can be done by sliding the switch forwards and
holding it for 2 seconds. With this mode active up/down on the right hat
increases and decreases the gain while left/right decreases and increases level.</p>
<p>Sliding the switch aft momentarily allows selection of used laser code, while
sliding it aft and holding allows for focus control. When set to laser code
change, the right four-way hat selects digit to change with left/right and
increases and decreases the selected digit with up/down. In focus control
up/down increases and decreases focus.</p>
<p>Located on the front of the stick (<num>7</num>) is a two-stage trigger, first
detent manually lasing while the second detent fires the laser and designates
QDES at current sensor position.</p>
<p>Lastly on the front side of the stick (<num>8</num>) is the latched laser fire
button. Selecting it fires the laser for 60 seconds which can be overridden by
the pressing and releasing the first trigger detent. A renewed press on the
laser latch button resets the latched laser fire timer to 60 seconds, beginning
a new 60 second countdown.</p>
<h2 id="startup"><a class="header" href="#startup">Startup</a></h2>
<p>To start the LANTIRN from cold, set the power switch to POD. This will start the
LANTIRN power-up sequence which takes 8 minutes. When ready, this will be
indicated by the MODE switch showing STBY.</p>
<p>When at STBY, depression of the MODE button switches the system to OPER
(Operational), enabling the LANTIRN sensor after a 30-second initialization.</p>
<p>Lastly, to allow display of LANTIRN FLIR video, select FLIR on the VIDEO switch.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="modes"><a class="header" href="#modes">Modes</a></h1>
<h2 id="sensor-modes-and-operation"><a class="header" href="#sensor-modes-and-operation">Sensor Modes and Operation</a></h2>
<p>The LANTIRN has two "master" modes, A/A and A/G. Both work similarly but are
optimized for different types of targets. Additionally, the A/G mode allows for
bomb release guidance.</p>
<p>The pod has two main ways of controlling the sensor line of sight, either via
contrast lock (image following) or via being slaved to a Q designation.</p>
<p>The Area and Point Track modes are the two contrast lock modes in which the
LANTIRN locks onto contrast differences in the LANTIRN FLIR video itself. This
in itself only allows for angle tracking which gives imprecise ranging using own
aircraft position and pod line of sight to calculate target position. It does
however allow the system to track moving targets.</p>
<p>The last tracking mode has the sensor slewed to a stored location/direction,
called a Q. The directional Qs do not allow for guidance to a location while the
location Qs do.</p>
<p>QSNO and QADL/QHUD are directional. QSNO slaves the sensor to the ground 15 NM
directly in front of the aircraft along own aircraft heading. QADL and QHUD
slave the sensor to either ADL (in A/A) or the aircraft wings symbol on the HUD
(in A/G).</p>
<p>The location Qs have two sources, QWp- and QWp+ on the stick’s left hat can be
used to cycle through the WCS waypoints, allowing the RIO to slew to the
different waypoints for navigation and target localization.</p>
<p>The other source is via pod designation. By selecting the second detent on the
LANTIRN trigger the current sensor track or location is lased and a new location
stored using that data. This is called the QDES and is used to designate targets
for engagement as well as allowing the RIO to select a new location for
navigational reference on the fly. The QDES can not however be automatically
transferred to the WCS, but the RIO can enter it manually using the target
location information in the pod video feed.</p>
<p>The lower right data-block is enabled for the location Qs only but will remain
even when the pod is slewed away in area or point track modes. As soon as
another Q is selected however, it will update to that location instead or be
removed if a directional Q is selected.</p>
<h2 id="ag-target-engagement-and-designation"><a class="header" href="#ag-target-engagement-and-designation">A/G Target Engagement and Designation</a></h2>
<p>The LANTIRN steering cues for ground target engagement are automatically enabled
when the LANTIRN is slewed to QDES or a new QDES is designated. The QDES itself
will remain even if a new Q is selected and as long as it exists, the steering
cues will point towards QDES even if slewed to another point. This is important
to keep in mind as it is easy to think that the steering commands are to the
current sensor location instead of the QDES.</p>
<p>The laser designation itself can however point to a different location than the
QDES as the laser always points to the current track. This can be used to
quickly change back to a target marked by the QDES if desired and when lasing a
moving target a QDES should be set at an estimated target location at impact
(estimated manually) and then the point track mode or manual slew can be used to
designate the actual target more precisely.</p>
<p>To change laser code, move the stick left side slider aft and release, this will
change right hat (S4) into laser code mode. The currently selected digit will
blink and the S4 hat can then be used to set the digits. Left/right change what
digit to set and up/down change the value of the digit. Renewed selection of aft
on the left slider will then exit the laser code mode.</p>
<p>If the right, S4, hat is depressed while in laser mode the automatic lase mode
will be enabled, indicated by the M (for manual) left of the digits changing to
an A (auto-lase). Repeat to switch back to manual mode. While activated, the
auto-lase mode will begin firing the laser at 10 seconds TIMP until TIMP zero +4
seconds.</p>
<p>The bomb release cue is only visible with a valid weapon (bomb) selected and the
selected bomb is read from the weapon selector wheel on the RIO armament panel
via the WCS. The actual bomb release can be accomplished using the computer
pilot or computer target modes but the manual mode is recommended. In manual
mode the pilot follows the cues in the LANTIRN video feed on the VDI and
releases the bomb when cued by the LANTIRN.</p>

necessarily holding one type of cartridge meaning that any combination of
cartridges is possible as long as each type’s quantity is a multiple of 10. The
system itself has no real knowledge of what is loaded where so incorrectly
programming the system can lead to the wrong type of cartridge being ejected.</p>
<p>The system itself can be operated manually from the control panel in the RIO pit
or the DLC thumbwheel on the pilot stick when the flaps lever is in the up
position. It is also capable of running programmed sequences of ejection which
in turn can be initiated manually by the RIO from the control panel or the
direction hats mounted on the hand hold over the DDD. In addition the AN/ALR-67
can also initiate the chaff ejection program if set up correctly on the
AN/ALE-39 control panel.</p>

<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/countermeasures/../../../img/general_cmds_programmer.jpg" alt="Programmer" /></p>
<p>The programmer is used to set up what countermeasure cartridges are loaded where
and to set up the different ejection programmes. The panel is located on the
right horizontal console of the RIO cockpit.</p>
<p>The left side of the programmer holds the controls (thumbwheels) for the
different ejection programmes, one section for each type of cartridge.</p>
<p>The <strong>CHAFF</strong> section controls how to eject chaff in program mode. The chaff
sequences are programmed to launch a number of salvoes, each consisting of a
burst of a set amount of cartridges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B QTY</strong> controls how many cartridges to eject in each burst, selection of
1-4 cartridges and C for continuous and R for random (4-6 cartridges)
possible.</li>
<li><strong>B INTV</strong> sets the time in seconds between each individual cartridge ejection
in each burst, possible settings being .1 (0.125), .2 (0.25), .5 (0.5), .7
(0.75), 1 and R for random.</li>
<li><strong>S QTY</strong> controls how many salvoes of bursts to eject in each program,
settings available are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15.</li>
<li><strong>S INT</strong> sets the time in seconds between each salvo in the program,
available settings are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the random and continuous settings for B special conditions apply.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B at C QTY</strong> and <strong>R INTV</strong> sets the first 3 cartridges to launch at 0.125
second intervals, the rest at random intervals from 0.25 to 4 seconds.
Ejection disregards the S settings and continue until all cartridges are
ejected.</li>
<li><strong>B at R QTY</strong> and <strong>R INTV</strong> sets each burst to have between 4-6 cartridges
and to eject at random intervals between 0.25 to 4 seconds. The first burst in
a salvo will always launch the first 3 cartridges at 0.125 second intervals.</li>
<li><strong>B at R QTY</strong> and <strong>INTV</strong> at set number sets each burst to launch between
4-6 cartridges at set interval. First burst will always launch first 3
cartridges at 0.125 sec interval.</li>
<li><strong>B at fixed QTY</strong> and <strong>R INTV</strong> sets each burst to eject one cartridge
disregarding B QTY.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>JAMMER</strong> section controls the ejection of jammer cartridges in programmed
mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QTY</strong> sets how many jammer cartridges to eject, possible settings are 1-4.</li>
<li><strong>INTV</strong> uses all three indicated thumbwheels to set time in seconds between
each ejection in the program. Settings from 1 to 299 possible in 1 second
increments.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Jammer cartridges not currently implemented in DCS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>FLARE</strong> section controls ejection of flares when using programmed mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QTY</strong> sets amount of flare cartridges to eject, possible settings being 2,
3, 4, 6, 8 and 10.</li>
<li><strong>INTV</strong> sets time interval between each ejection in seconds, possible
settings being 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>The right side of the programmer sets the type of cartridge loaded into each
section and the reset switch used after loading new cartridges.</p>
<p>The <strong>L10</strong>, <strong>L20</strong>, <strong>R10</strong> and <strong>R20</strong> thumbwheels can be set to C, J or F
setting what cartridge is loaded into which section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Incorrectly setting type of cartridge loaded can result in the launch of
the wrong type of cartridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>RESET</strong> switch needs to be used to reset the system's internal counters
after loading new cartridges into the launchers. Needs to be held to reset for
at least 5 seconds to reset the system.</p>
<h3 id="control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#control-panel-1">Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/countermeasures/../../../img/general_cmds_controller.jpg" alt="Controller" /></p>
<p>The control panel is used to control system power, to set up automatic ejections
and to manually eject cartridges and is also located on the RIO right horizontal
console.</p>
<p>The mechanical counters on the upper part of the panel are used to indicate
remaining cartridges of each type. They need to be set up manually using the
knob below each counter but decreases automatically as each cartridge ejection
pulse is sent. As they’re set manually it’s possible to end up in a situation
were the counter is at 0 but additional cartridges are still available. In this
cases ejection pulses will still be sent but the counter will remain at 0.</p>
<p>Below each counter each cartridge type has a switch for manual ejection
commands. The switches are momentary and spring-loaded to center, each having
three positions. <strong>PRGM</strong> initiates respective set ejection program, <strong>SGL</strong>
commands ejection of a single cartridge of respective type and <strong>STBY</strong> is the
default center position not commanding manual ejection.</p>
<p>The <strong>PWR/MODE</strong> switch enables power to the AN/ALE-39 and can enable automatic
chaff launch via the AN/ALR-67 RWR. <strong>AUTO (CHAFF) / MAN</strong> enables power to the
system and allows the AN/ALR-67 to initiate the set chaff ejection program but
flares remain in manual. Chaff ejection is initiated when the RWR detects a
threat actively engaging own aircraft, after each program initiation a 30 second
cool-down is present before next program is initiated if such a detection is
still present. Manual ejection is still available as normal. <strong>MAN</strong> enables
power to the system and allows for manual initiation of all functions. <strong>OFF</strong>
disables the system.</p>
<p>The <strong>FLARE MODE</strong> switch controls how flares are ejected and also sets up how
the pilot stick <strong>DLC button is used</strong>. The flaps lever needs to be in the up
position to enable DLC button cartridge ejection. The switch has three
positions. <strong>MULT</strong>, multiple, sets the system to eject one cartridge from each
section set to flares on the programmer for each ejection pulse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 That this means that if flares are loaded on all four sections this results
in 4 flares being launched each time a flare ejection command is sent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NORM</strong> sets normal flare ejection pulse behavior. <strong>PILOT</strong> enables ejection
of one flare cartridge with each depression of the DLC button. Normal flare
ejection still possible. If the switch is set a position <strong>other than PILOT</strong>
the DLC button will command ejection of a single chaff cartridge.</p>
<p>Finally the <em>SALVO FLARES</em> switch initiates rapid ejection of all flares using a
0.125 second time interval. Normally spring-loaded to the <em>OFF</em> position. Can’t
be stopped once initiated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: All countermeasure cartridge ejection is inhibited while the
weight on wheels sensor is active, preventing countermeasure ejection while on
the ground.</p>

<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/countermeasures/../../../img/general_cmds_cmhats.jpg" alt="CM Hats" /></p>
<p>Two four-way direction hats are mounted on the RIO hand hold above the DDD to
enable quick access to countermeasure ejection. The two switches are mirrored
and <strong>UP</strong> commands ejection of a single chaff cartridge. <strong>DOWN</strong> initiates the
chaff ejection program, <strong>INBOARD</strong> (towards center) initiates the jammer
ejection program and <strong>OUTBOARD</strong> (towards the sides) initiates the flare
ejection program.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lau-138"><a class="header" href="#lau-138">LAU-138</a></h1>
<p>The LAU-138 chaff dispenser was developed to meet the need for additional chaff
cartridge payload capacity. The launcher itself was developed in Sweden by
CelsiusTech as a chaff dispenser integrated into a rail designed to replace the
LAU-7 Sidewinder rail. Each rail holds up to 160 chaff packages, each being
smaller than a normal chaff cartridge while still enabling the mounting of a
single AIM-9 Sidewinder to itself.</p>
<p>On the F-14 the LAU-138 was used mounted on the 1A and 8A stations. While
technically able to be mounted on the respective B stations as well, it wasn’t
possible to refill the launcher while mounted there so wasn’t used there
operationally.</p>
<p>While having the LAU-138s mounted, the R10 and R20 sections in the launcher are
both connected to the R20 section and the R10 connected to the LAU-138s. This
means that the R20 section type setting on the programmer controls both R10 and
R20 and the R10 section type setting should always be set to C for chaff.</p>
<p>Each launcher holds, as mentioned, 160 chaff packages and each ejection impulse
ejects four packages from each launcher, each package being about 1/4 the size
of a normal chaff cartridge. This results in that each ejection impulse ejects
the equivalent of two chaff cartridges in total and that a total of 40 ejections
are available from the launchers.</p>
<p>As the launchers use the R10 section of the programmer, mounting two LAU-138s
results means that the counter for chaff on the controller should be increased
by 40. A chaff only loadout can result in the number of launches available to be
in total 100, which is too much for the counter, and that the counter will
effectively show one chaff ejection less than what’s really available. The last
ejection will still work though.</p>
<p>In summary, this means that when using the LAU-138 an additional 40 chaff
ejections are available increasing the total number to anywhere from 100 chaff
to 40 chaff and 60 flares when combined with the normal AN/ALE-39 loadout and
that the R10 section should always be set to C for chaff when mounted.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="radar-warning-receiver"><a class="header" href="#radar-warning-receiver">Radar Warning Receiver</a></h1>
<p>Two sets of Radar Warning Receivers are available for the Tomcat. The ALR-45/50
and the later ALR-67.</p>
<p>They are capable of passively detect radar threats, increasing situational
awareness of the crew.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/rwr/../../../img/rwr_overview.jpg" alt="Flying" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="analr-67-rwr"><a class="header" href="#analr-67-rwr">AN/ALR-67 RWR</a></h1>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver (RWR) is designed to inform and alert the
F-14 crew about radar emitters in their general area. It’s also designed to help
the crew defend themselves from hostile threats by indicate radar TRKing and
engagement by radar guided weapons.</p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 was integrated in the F-14 to replace the ageing AN/ALR-45 and
AN/ALR-50, at first for the F-14B and later on for parts of the F-14A fleet.
Until the advent of the PMDIG upgrade the AN/ALR-67 used its own stand-alone
display system only. The RWR is however connected to the AN/ALQ-126 allowing it
to send info on threat emitters to the jammer and also display jammed targets on
its own display. It can also trigger preprogrammed countermeasure programs set
up in the AN/ALE-39 system.</p>
<p>On later F-14B aircraft incorporating the PTID upgrade the AN/ALR-67 was also
integrated into the MDIG displays system, allowing for a more detailed threat
display on the ECMD.</p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 on the F-14B has four small spiral high-band antennas, four
wide-band high-band quadrant receivers and a low-band array. Connected to these
antennas is a narrow-band superheterodyne receiver analyzing the received
signals and indicating emitters and threats to both pilot and RIO using two
displays, one at each seat and by audio signals played to the ICS of both</p>
<h2 id="controls-1"><a class="header" href="#controls-1">Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/rwr/../../../img/general_alr-67_control.jpg" alt="Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 RWR is controlled by a control panel on the RIO right side
horizontal panel.</p>
<p>The PWR (power) switch control power to the RWR and should be set to ON to
operate the system.</p>
<p>The VOL (volume) control knob sets RIO audio level for the RWR sound
indications. The pilot has a corresponding control on his Volume/TACAN command
panel.</p>
<p>The TEST switch has two selectable modes and is spring-loaded to center when not
held. Momentary selection of the BIT position initiates the AN/ALR-67 built in
test and if the switch is held in the SPL (special) position while on the first
BIT page displays the special BIT status page as long as it’s held in that
position.</p>
<p>The MODE switch also has two selectable modes used while held in the respective
position, spring-loaded to return to center when not held. When not activated
enables normal operational mode, OFST enables the offset mode when held and LMT
the limit mode when held. The offset mode is indicated by an O in the status
ring on the display and separates overlapping threat symbols sacrificing azimuth
accuracy to instead show all threats clearly. The limit mode is indicated by an
L in the status ring on the display and limits the display to only show the
threat symbols of the six highest prioritized threats.</p>
<p>The DISPLAY TYPE selector sets what threat display priority to use on the RWR
displays.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NORM</strong> - Normal is indicated by a N in the status ring on the display and
shows threat symbology according to the loaded threat library.</li>
<li><strong>AI</strong> - Airborne interceptor is indicated by an I in the status ring on the
display and prioritizes all airborne interceptor threats above all other
threats.</li>
<li><strong>AAA</strong> - Anti-aircraft artillery is indicated by an A in the status ring on
the display and prioritizes all anti-aircraft artillery threats above all
other threats.</li>
<li><strong>UNK</strong> - Unknown is indicated by a U in the status ring on the display and
prioritizes all unknown threats above all other threats.</li>
<li><strong>FRIEND</strong> - Friendly is indicated by an F in the status ring on the display
and allows for the same prioritization as in normal but also displays known
friendly emitters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="displays-1"><a class="header" href="#displays-1">Displays</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/rwr/../../../img/general_alr-67_display.jpg" alt="Display" /></p>
<p>The RWR display is identical at both positions in the cockpit and uses three
bands (circles) on the display to indicate the threat level of the displayed
threat symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outermost, critical band:</strong> Displays threat symbols belonging to emitters
representing an imminent threat to own aircraft, either a locked-on TRKing
radar or a radar detected to be actively engaging own aircraft. A threat
symbol belonging to a TRK detected as actively engaging own aircraft is
enhanced by flashing its symbol.</li>
<li><strong>Middle, lethal band:</strong> Displays threat symbols belonging to emitters
representing threat systems deemed within lethal range of own aircraft but not
actively TRKing or engaging it.</li>
<li><strong>Inner, non-lethal band:</strong> Displays threat symbols belonging to emitters not
representing a system capable of engaging own aircraft or systems capable of
but not deemed within range to engage it.</li>
<li><strong>System status circle:</strong> Indicates various system modes in use or the
presence of failures. The upper left quadrant displays what display type is
set (N, I, A, U, or F), the upper right quadrant showing an L if limited
display mode is used, and the lower half indicating either the use of the
offset display mode by indicating an O, the presence of a BIT failure by
showing B, or that the system is thermally overloaded (too warm) by showing a
T.</li>
<li><strong>Display intensity knob:</strong> On the lower right side, it controls display
intensity on the display it’s attached to.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The ordering of the three threat bands has changed at least once since the
introduction of the AN/ALR-67, and as the modeled AN/ALR-67 represents one of
the earlier versions we’ve chosen the present order.</p>

</div>
<p>The two crewmembers have warning lights dedicated to specific threats on their
front cockpit panels. The pilot warning lights are situated on the right side of
the HUD and the RIO warning lights on the right side of the TID. The RIO warning
light panel also contains lights for the AN/ALQ-126 and the IFF transponder,
those are detailed under their respective section.</p>
<p>The different lights illuminate to indicate the presence of a certain type of
threat in the critical band of the RWR and when an active engagement is detected
the corresponding light starts flashing. The categories present are <strong>SAM</strong>
(surface-to-air missile), <strong>AAA</strong> (anti-air artillery), <strong>AI</strong> (airborne
interceptor), and (only in the RIO pit) <strong>CW</strong> (continuous wave).</p>
<h2 id="threat-indication-alert-tones"><a class="header" href="#threat-indication-alert-tones">Threat Indication Alert Tones</a></h2>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 uses four distinct audio tones to indicate threats and status
changes of those threats.</p>
<p>A single short tone is used to indicate the presence of a new emitter or when a
threat is moved to another threat band.</p>
<p>A slow warbling, alternating tone is used to indicate the presence of a threat
in the critical band.</p>
<p>A fast warbling, alternating tone is used to indicate that a threat is actively
engaging own aircraft.</p>
<p>A special four tone audio signal, pitch decreasing with each tone, is used to
indicate a special event as programmed by the threat library. In the Heatblur
DCS F-14 this represents a new threat tied to a system capable of silently
engaging own aircraft, i.e. it can engage own aircraft without causing it’s
threat symbol to move to the critical band and thus no additional audio warning
tones. This capability is either because of that the launching aircraft is
capable of launching missiles in a TWS mode or that a launching SAM system can
guide missiles by other means than radar and thus not giving further warning of
an active engagement.</p>
<h2 id="bit"><a class="header" href="#bit">BIT</a></h2>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 BIT cycles between different test screens testing the screen,
symbology and threat indication tones as well as displaying system revision and
threat library information.</p>
<p>The first page displayed shows system and threat library revision and the
following screens test the symbol generation of the displays.</p>
<p>The threat indication tones are also tested during the bit, first page tests the
status change tone, second page the special tone, third page the threat in
critical band tone and the fourth the fast warbling active threat tone.</p>
<p>During the tests the threat warning lights also illuminate for both the pilot
and the RIO.</p>

<p>The AN/ALR-45 and AN/ALR-50 combination was introduced during the early 70s as a
response to the increasingly lethal SAM and AAA systems introduced during that
era. It's purpose is to inform the crew about threats and help them defend
against them by indicating reception of threat emissions and when they pose a
threat to the aircraft. Similarly to ALR-67 it's working in cooperation with
DECM jammer (ALQ-100).</p>
<p>The AN/ALR-45 has four quadrant receiver antennas located on the front sides of
the engine intakes as well as the trailing outer edges of the stabilators to
provide a 360 degree coverage of the aircraft. It provides a general ECM
situational awareness as well as indicating emitters locking onto and attacking
the aircraft.</p>
<p>The AN/ALR-50 is a dedicated missile warning system and has one upper antenna
located aft of the cockpit and another lower antenna located on one of the nose
gear doors. The purpose of the AN/ALR-50 is to detect and warn about possible
missile launches. It can identify <strong>MA (missile alert)</strong> and <strong>ML (missile
launch)</strong> conditions for some of the radars which use missile command-link
signals. (Currently in DCS the MA should be interpreted as lock and ML as
launch)</p>
<p>Both systems are used as a combined set and can be used to trigger
countermeasure program release from the AN/ALE-39 as well as triggering the DECM
into transmission.</p>
<p>The system displays threats on the pilot HSD and the RIO ECMD when they are set
to ECM. Via the display controls the ECM can be allowed to override the current
display if a threat is detected.</p>
<h2 id="controls-2"><a class="header" href="#controls-2">Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/rwr/../../../img/general_alr-45_control.jpg" alt="Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The main <strong>ECM</strong> control panel for the AN/ALR-45 and AN/ALR-50 is located on the
RIO's right horizontal console. The power switch for both system is located on
the right side of this control panel and is labeled <strong>PWR - ALR-45/50</strong>
(<num>5</num>).</p>
<p>The three three-position switches (<num>1</num>, <num>2</num> and <num>3</num>)
on the top control the three operating bands of the AN/ALR-45 allowing exclusive
display of that band or removal of that band from the displays. The upper
position, <strong>BYPASS</strong>, is momentary and holding the switch to that position
allows all signals in that band through regardless of their parameters, normally
only those matching threats are passed through. Holding a band to <strong>BYPASS</strong>
removes the other two band from the display completely though which is why the
switch is automatically returned to <strong>NORM</strong> when released. The <strong>NORM</strong>
position allows for normal operation of that band. The lower position,
<strong>DEFEAT</strong>, is locked out and the switch need to be lifted to allow movement to
this position. The <strong>DEFEAT</strong> position completely disables the selected band.</p>
<p>The middle volume knob, <num>4</num>, controls the audio levels of the AN/ALR-45
and AN/ALR-50 in the RIO's headset. The outside part of the knob controls audio
from the AN/ALR-45 and can be turned off if needed. The inside part controls
audio from the AN/ALR-50 can't be completely turned off as it controls the MA/ML
tones.</p>
<p>The <strong>AAA</strong> switch (<num>10</num>) enables or disables display of strobes
relating to AAA threats, the threat acronym and indicator lights still function.
<strong>NORM</strong> allows normal operation and display of AAA threats and <strong>DEFEAT</strong>
disables the strobes.</p>
<p>The <strong>UNKNOWN</strong> switch (<num>6</num>) disables display of normal threats and
display all unknown signals not identified as normal threats as solid strobes,
the UNK acronym will be display whenever there are any present. The <strong>DISPLAY</strong>
position allows this display and is momentary and needs to be held and the
<strong>OFF</strong> position allows normal AN/ALR-45 operation.</p>
<p>The three test switches (<num>7</num>, <num>8</num> and <num>9</num>) are all
spring-loaded to center and allows for activation of BIT for the selected band
or system. The <strong>TEST - LOW/OFF/MID</strong> switch enables BIT of the AN/ALR-45
<strong>LOW</strong> and <strong>MID</strong> band. The <strong>LOW</strong> position should result in a dotted strobe
in each quadrant as well as audio and associated warning lights and acronyms for
AAA and SAM LOW. The <strong>MID</strong> position should result in a dot-dash strobe in each
quadrant as well as audio and associated warning lights and acronyms for AAA/AI
and SAM MID. The <strong>TEST - ML/OFF</strong> switch enables BIT of the AN/ALR-50 in the
<strong>ML</strong> position and should result in flashing SAM lights and range rings on the
display as well as associated audio tones. The <strong>TEST - HIGH/OFF</strong> switch
enables BIT of the AN/ALR-45 high band in the <strong>HIGH</strong> band and should result in
a dashed strobe in each of the four quadrants on the display as well as audio
and associated warning lights and acronyms for AI and SAM HIGH.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/rwr/../../../img/general_alr-45_display.jpg" alt="Display" /></p>
<p>The <strong>ECM DISPLAY</strong> control panel is also located on the RIO's right horizontal
console. It controls the RIO's <strong>ECMD</strong> display as well as generic display
settings for both displays.</p>
<p>The <strong>ECM - CORR</strong> switch (<num>1</num>) allows setting how the two systems
correlate their threats. It is spring-loaded back to <strong>ML</strong>. The <strong>MA/ML</strong>
position is a momentary position and allows the RIO to correlate AN/ALR-50
threats with a <strong>MA</strong> or <strong>ML</strong> condition to a AN/ALR-45 threats. The <strong>ML</strong>
position, which is the normal switch position, sets the ECM to only correlate a
AN/ALR-50 threats to an AN/ALR-45 threats if a <strong>ML</strong> condition occurs. The
<strong>OFF</strong> position defeats (disables) the correlation momentarily allowing for
normal uncorrelated threat display.</p>
<p>The <strong>ECM - ORIDE</strong> switch (<num>2</num>) controls when the ECM can override the
NAV display on the <strong>ECMD</strong>. The <strong>ML</strong> position allows override if a <strong>ML</strong>
condition occurs. The <strong>ML/AI</strong> position allows override if a <strong>ML</strong> condition
occurs or an <strong>AI</strong> (Airborne Intercept, i.e. fighter radar) is detected. The
<strong>OFF</strong> position disables override.</p>
<p>The <strong>MODE</strong> switch (<num>3</num>) selects which system to display on the
<strong>ECMD</strong>. <strong>ECM</strong> displays the ECM and <strong>NAV</strong> displays NAV.</p>
<p>The <strong>DATA/ADF</strong> switch (<num>4</num>) controls what additional text information
to display in the NAV mode. <strong>BOTH</strong> displays ADF and general navigation
information, <strong>DATA</strong> displays only the general navigation information and
<strong>OFF</strong> disables all extra text.</p>
<p>The switch controlling display of ECM information to the pilot is located on the

<p>The two crewmembers have warning lights dedicated to specific threats on their
front cockpit panels. The pilot warning lights are situated on the right side of
the HUD and the RIO warning lights on the right side of the TID. The RIO warning
light panel also contains lights for the AN/ALQ-100 and the IFF transponder,
those are detailed under their respective section.</p>
<p>The different lights illuminate to indicate the presence of a certain type of
threat.</p>
<h2 id="threat-indication-alert-tones-1"><a class="header" href="#threat-indication-alert-tones-1">Threat Indication Alert Tones</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 types of sound produced by ALR-45/50:</p>

<p>The AN/ALQ-100 and 126 jammers are designed to detect radar threats, analyze them, select the
optimum countermeasure technique available and apply it. Available techniques for jamming are
amongst others, mainlobe blanking, inverse con-scan, range-gate pull-off and swept square modes.</p>
<p>In real life these two systems differ greatly with the AN/ALQ-126 being by far the most effective
system. In DCS both are modelled as a simple noise jammers due to engine limitations but controlled
by the DECM logic as to when it’s on or off and thus work the same.</p>
<h2 id="decm-controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#decm-controls-and-indicators">DECM Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/general_alq-126_control.jpg" alt="Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The controls for the DECM are all located on the right horizontal panel in the RIO pit, panel as
image above. In addition there are two indication lights co-located with the RWR threat indicators
on the right side of the TID.</p>
<p>The two indication lights on the threat advisory are RCV (recieve) and XMIT (transmit). RCV
illuminates up when the system detects and analyzes a threat while the XMIT illuminates up when it's
actively jamming a threat.</p>
<p>The control panel itself contains a STANDBY indicator light, a mode selector knob and an AUDIO
volume knob.</p>
<p>The STANDBY light indicates that system warmup is not yet completed and when completed turns off. At
other times, illumination of this indicator indicates the presence of a fault in the system.</p>
<p>The AUDIO (volume) knob controls the audio volume of the RIO sound from the system. The pilot has no
access to this audio unless he put his amplifier selector to <strong>EMER</strong> (to use RIO amplifier). The
audio itself is generated based on radar signal characteristics (mainly PRF).</p>
<p>The mode selector knob controls power and operational mode that the system is in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OFF</strong> turns off power to the system. <strong>STBY</strong> begins pre-warming of the system, taking in all
around 5 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>TEST - HOLD 3 SEC</strong> is used to prepare the system for BIT, after 3 seconds in this mode, turn
the knob to TEST - ACT.</li>
<li><strong>TEST - ACT</strong> starts the BIT in the system. The BIT takes approximately 30 seconds and the RCV
light will be illuminated the whole time while the XMIT light will flash twice. If the STANDBY
light illuminates it indicates that a no-go condition exists in the system.</li>
<li><strong>REC</strong> enables the system in recieve only mode, enabling analysis of threats and also the threat
audio.</li>
<li><strong>RPT</strong> enables full system functionality, in addition to REC it also now tries to jam threats
according to selected method.</li>
</ul>

<p>💡 In DCS jamming is always done with noise jamming, turning on as a threat is detected.</p>

<h3 id="fire-detection-system"><a class="header" href="#fire-detection-system">Fire Detection System</a></h3>
<p>The fire detection system in the F-14 has two fire sensing loops, one in each
engine.</p>
<p>If these loops detects a temperature over 600 °F (about 316 °C) along its whole
length or 1,000 °F (about 538 °C) in a single 6-inch section it triggers the
fire detection circuits. The left detection loop illuminates the left fire
warning light on the ACM panel and the right detection loop illuminates the
right fire warning light, see Air Combat Maneuver Panel.</p>
<p>In addition there are also sensors designed to detect hot air leaks in the
engines and illuminate the BLEED DUCT caution light on the pilot caution -
advisory indicator (see Caution - Advisory Indicator) if temperatures above 575
°F (about 302 °C) are detected.</p>

</div>
<p>The fire suppression system in the F-14 contains two bottles filled with a fire
suppression agent capable of being discharged into one engine selected by the
pilot. Though the system contains two bottles, both are discharged at the same
time making the system a one-shot system, capable of extinguishing only one
engine.</p>
<p>As the effectiveness of the agent depends on it remaining in the engine until
the fire is out the effectiveness is greater at lower airspeed as it takes
longer for the agent to be blown clear of the engine. The agent itself is a low
toxicity agent, designed to do as little damage to the engine as possible while
still being an effective fire suppressant.</p>
<p>To activate the system the pilot pulls the <strong>FUEL SHUT OFF</strong> handle (pictured
above) corresponding to the alight engine and pushes the fire extinguisher
button behind that handle. The pull-out of the handle shuts off the fuel to the
connected engine and the button behind it releases the fire suppression agent
into that engine.</p>
<p>Two advisory lights are connected to this system, each one indicating low
pressure in one of the fire suppression agent bottles. The <strong>ENG FIRE EXT</strong>
indicates low pressure in the main bottle and the <strong>AUX FIRE EXT</strong> the same in
the auxiliary bottle. Both are located on the pilot caution - advisory
indicator, see Caution - Advisory Indicator.</p>
<p>The advisory lights will both illuminate after a successful application of the
system and will also indicate if an error drains the pressure in the bottles.</p>
<h3 id="fire-detection-and-suppression-system-test"><a class="header" href="#fire-detection-and-suppression-system-test">Fire Detection and Suppression System Test</a></h3>
<p>Both systems can be tested by selection of the <strong>FIRE DET/EXT</strong> position on the
master test panel switch. (See Master Test Panel.) This will illuminate both
fire warning lights on the ACM panel if their respective loop is functional and
the <strong>GO</strong> light on the master test panel will illuminate if the suppression
system is functional. If the <strong>NO GO</strong> or no lights illuminate there’s a problem
in either the suppression system or the test circuitry.</p>
<h2 id="ejection-system"><a class="header" href="#ejection-system">Ejection System</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat is equipped with dual Martin-Baker GRU-7A rocket-assisted
ejection seats, one for the pilot, one for the RIO. The ejection system is a
zero/zero system, capable of successfully ejecting the crewmembers at zero
airspeed, stationary, on the ground.</p>
<p>As the F-14 is a two seat aircraft it has additional controls apart from the
ejection handles and arming systems, namely the ejection command lever. This
lever, which is located in the RIO cockpit, selects if the RIO ejects the pilot
as well when he ejects.</p>
<p>The lever is situated beside the sensor control panel, see Eject Command Lever.
When set to <strong>PILOT</strong>, the pilot ejects both crewmembers, while the RIO ejects
only himself. When set to <strong>MCO</strong> both crewmembers eject both crewmembers.</p>
<p>The system does not allow pilot-only ejection because it would be undesirable
for the RIO to remain in the aircraft alone.</p>
<p>The pilot has indication of what position the ejection command lever is at on
the Landing Gear Control Panel, the <strong>EJECT CMD</strong> flip-flop indicator showing
<strong>PILOT</strong> when the lever is in pilot and <strong>MCO</strong> when in MCO.</p>
<p>If the canopy does not jettison when initiating the ejection sequence it’s
possible to manually jettison it using the Canopy Jettison Handle in the pilot
cockpit or the Canopy Jettison Handle in the RIO cockpit. If the canopy
inhibited ejection after ejection initiation, jettisoning the canopy will most
likely restart it. If ejection is needed during a flat spin, it’s also
recommended to manually jettison the canopy and allow it to clear before
initiating the ejection sequence as the canopy might need longer to clear during
a flat spin.</p>
<h2 id="jettison-system"><a class="header" href="#jettison-system">Jettison System</a></h2>
<p>The Jettison system has four modes of operation: emergency, ACM, selective, and
auxiliary.</p>
<h3 id="emergency-jettison"><a class="header" href="#emergency-jettison">Emergency Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The emergency jettison is selected via the <strong>EMERG STORES JETT</strong> on the Landing
Gear Control Panel. Selection causes the <strong>EMERG JETT</strong> caution light to
illuminate on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator.</p>
<p>The emergency jettison requires only no weight on wheels indicated (no master
arm) and ejects all stores except for Sidewinders.</p>
<h3 id="acm-jettison"><a class="header" href="#acm-jettison">ACM Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The ACM jettison is selected via the <strong>ACM JETT</strong> button under the ACM
cover/switch on the Air Combat Maneuver Panel.</p>
<p>The ACM jettison, like the emergency jettison, requires no master arm but
instead requires that the landing gear lever is up. Unlike the emergency
jettison the ACM jettison only ejects those stations selected by the RIO on the
Armament Panel (set to <strong>SEL</strong> or <strong>B</strong> for stations 1 and 8).</p>
<h3 id="selective-jettison"><a class="header" href="#selective-jettison">Selective Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The selective jettison is set and executed by the RIO on the Armament Panel.
This mode of jettisoning requires the landing gear handle to be in the up
position and the master arm to be on.</p>
<p>The procedure for jettison in selective mode is to set the desired station
switches to <strong>SEL</strong> and hold the <strong>SEL JETT</strong> switch to <strong>JETT</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="auxiliary-jettison"><a class="header" href="#auxiliary-jettison">Auxiliary Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The auxiliary jettison mode is a backup mode to use when the other modes have
failed. Like the selective jettison mode it requires the landing gear handle to
be up and the master arm to be on.</p>
<p>This mode can only eject air-to-ground stores and ejects them by actuating the
normal release hooks. This means that the aircraft needs to fly straight and
level as the stores are not ejected forcefully but instead just released and
cleared using gravity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 No jettison mode can jettison ITERs or stores loaded on those, they need to
be dropped like normal, with or without the fuzes armed.</p>

<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_m61.jpg" alt="M-61 Vulcan" /> <em>U.S. Navy photo by Photographers Mate
Airman Kristopher Wilson. (041129-N-5345W-034)</em></p>
<p>The M-61 Vulcan is a six-barreled hydraulically driven 20 mm automatic cannon
capable of firing over 6,000 rpm (rounds per minute).</p>
<p>The F-14 carries the gun internally mounted beneath the cockpit with the muzzle
being located on the lower left side of the fuselage. 676 20 mm rounds are
carried in the ammunition drum for the gun and retain the spent cases after the
rounds have been fired.</p>
<p>The gun itself is mounted to be elevated slightly more than 3° from the ADL to
provide built-in lead for dog-fight situations.</p>
<p>To fire the gun, no input is needed from the WCS, the gun can be fired by the
trigger on the pilot stick when selected by the weapons selector on that same
stick, provided master arm is on. The WCS can, however, provide symbology on the
HUD to increase gun accuracy. For both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes the
gun has two sights available. For air-to-air it’s the manual sight and the RTGS
(real-time gun sight).</p>
<p>Selection of the gun is indicated on the bottom of the HUD by a capital G with
remaining hundreds of rounds indicated below.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_rounds.jpg" alt="Rounds Indicator" /></p>
<p>Apart from the indication on the HUD, the rounds remaining indicator on the
pilot right vertical panel also shows remaining rounds. The indicator counts
down from 650 but can manually be reset by rotating the knob below the indicator
to the desired quantity.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_rate.jpg" alt="Gun Rate Selector" /></p>
<p>The gun is capable of a 4,000 rpm or 6,000 rpm mode. The lower rate is normally
used for air-to-ground engagement and the higher rate for air-to-air engagement.
The gun rate is selected by the GUN RATE switch on the ACM, which also indicates
the selected option. Selection of ACM will set it to high automatically. The
maximum number of bullets fired by a trigger pull can be set to be either 50,
100, 200, or unlimited. The default value is 200 bullets but can be set
otherwise by the ground crew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In DCS this is set via the kneeboard.</p>

<h2 id="manual-air-to-air-sight"><a class="header" href="#manual-air-to-air-sight">Manual Air-to-Air Sight</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_gunhudmanual.jpg" alt="Manual Air-to-Air Sight" /></p>
<p>In manual mode, the HUD displays the ADL, the armament legend, and the manual
pipper. This mode is accessed by depressing and releasing the CAGE/SEAM
pushbutton on the left throttle when in the air-to-air mode with the gun
selected. In this mode, the pilot has to manually aim the gun using the manual
pipper as a reference to hit the target. Real target range and needed deflection
need to be estimated by the pilot.</p>
<p>The manual piper is adjustable to enable the selection of the desired lead. The
GUN ELEV panel on the pilot right vertical panel sets the lead; normally, this
should be set to 53 milliradians to place the manual pipper on the gun sight
line.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_gunelevation.jpg" alt="Gun Elevation Panel" /></p>
<h2 id="real-time-gunsight-rtgs"><a class="header" href="#real-time-gunsight-rtgs">Real-Time Gunsight (RTGS)</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_gunhudrtgsnotarget.jpg" alt="RTGS No Target" /></p>
<p>The real-time gunsight mode is the standard gun mode when in the air-to-air mode
with the gun selected.</p>
<p>In RTGS, the WCS computes the bullet trajectory and displays the location the
bullets will pass through at 1,000 and 2,000 feet, if no target data is
available from the WCS. The pipper represents bullet location at 1,000 feet and
the diamond represents the bullet location at 2,000 feet.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_gunhudrtgs.jpg" alt="RTGS Target" /></p>
<p>If target data is available from the WCS (target tracked in an STT mode), the
pipper instead displays bullet location at the target’s current range out to
4,000 feet. The diamond will display radar line of sight to the target (target
location). This means that when having a target track, the pilot should fly the
aircraft to place the pipper over the target to hit it.</p>
<p>In addition to computing the solution to put bullets at the target's location,
the RTGS sight will also calculate where the bullets actually are in relation to
the target when at target range. When the bullets fired are computed to be at
the target’s location, the diamond switches from target indication to indicating
bullet position at target range (BATR). This is also indicated by the diamond
flashing.</p>
<p>Using this symbology, it’s possible to see where the target would have needed to
be to be hit by the bullets. If the gun engagement was executed successfully,
this means that the diamond should still be on top of the target, blinking,
indicating that the bullets passed through the target’s location.</p>

<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_attkmode.jpg" alt="Attack Mode" /></p>
<p>The manual air-to-ground sight works and looks the same way as the manual
air-to-air sight except that it’s set by the RIO using the ATTK MODE selector on
the armament control panel that’s located on the RIO left vertical panel.
Selecting MAN on that selector enables the same HUD symbology as in the manual
air-to-air sight upon the selection of the air-to-ground mode, the only
additional HUD symbology being the display of the radar altitude on the right
side of the HUD. The gun deflection should instead be set according to a
pre-calculated setting depending on airspeed, target range, and dive angle.</p>
<h2 id="computerpilot-mode"><a class="header" href="#computerpilot-mode">Computer/Pilot Mode</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_guncomputerpilot.jpg" alt="Computer/Pilot Mode" /></p>
<p>Computer/pilot mode is used to have the WCS continuously compute a weapon impact
point for, among other air-to-ground weapons, the gun. It is set by the RIO on
the ATTK MODE selector, as for manual air-to-ground sight, by selecting
CMPTR-PLT.</p>
<p>In this mode, the AN/AWG-9 radar is slaved to the weapon impact point for
accurate range measurements and enables the HUD display of that same impact
point.</p>
<p>The HUD uses the pipper to indicate a real-time weapon impact point and the
diamond to indicate out of range. When the diamond disappears, the gun is in
range to engage a target under the pipper. The pull-up cue moves vertically on
the HUD and when it’s at or above the weapon impact point (pipper), it indicates
that an immediate pull-up is required to avoid striking the ground and that the
target is too close to engage safely.</p>
<p>The right side of the HUD displays the barometric altitude scale.</p>
<h2 id="mixed-gun-mode"><a class="header" href="#mixed-gun-mode">Mixed Gun Mode</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/weapons_gunmixed.jpg" alt="Mixed Mode" /></p>
<p>The gun can also be used at the same time as another air-to-ground munition is
selected by setting the A/G GUN switch on the armament panel (on the RIO left
vertical panel) to MIXED. This enables the trigger to fire the gun but no HUD
symbology is available for the gun as it’s being used to display release data
for the selected munition. In this mode, the pilot needs to estimate the gun
impact point manually with the ADL as the only reference on the HUD.</p>

selected weapon max and minimum ranges as indicated by the dashes (-).</p>
<p>The Movable Reticle (called pipper for air to ground and gun employment) and the
Target Designator can show different things depending on current situation.</p>
<p>The Movable Reticle shows current TCS line of sight if it exists at the same

it instead shows current AIM-9 seeker head line of sight.</p>
<p>The Target Designator diamond shows current radar STT line of sight if present
and if not it instead shows the current TCS line of sight.</p>

2nd Class Felix Garza Jr. (030320-N-4142G-013)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Depicted missile has yet to have the forward fins attached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AIM-54 Phoenix is a long-range air-to-air missile originally designed for
the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, which never materialized. When the F-111B
project was scrapped, the AIM-54 and the corresponding AN/AWG-9 WCS eventually
found their way to the F-14.</p>
<p>The F-14 is capable of carrying up to 6 AIM-54 missiles, four on rails on the
fuselage and one each on the glove pylons. Because of the missile cooling system
used, the two front Phoenix pylons must always be mounted, meaning that the rear
fuselage pylons can’t be used if the front ones aren’t present. The glove pylons
contain their own cooling systems.</p>
<p>The missile is capable of engagement both against a single target in STT and
multiple targets using track-while-search (TWS).</p>
<p>The AIM-54 is available in two different versions, the AIM-54A and the AIM-54C.
The Heatblur Simulations F-14 Tomcat models both versions as well as the AIM-54A
with both mk47 and mk60 rocket motors. The two motors on the AIM-54A differ in
effective range, while the AIM-54C differs by having a digital seeker instead of
an analog one, increasing its performance, as well as an improved, smokeless
mk47 rocket motor.</p>
<p>The AIM-54 has a range of at least 60 NM against a fighter-sized target at high
altitudes in pulse doppler STT. When using TWS for engagement against multiple
targets, this drops to about 50 NM. It has a greater range against large targets
and vice versa against smaller targets.</p>
<p>If launched in active mode, the range drops to about 10 NM for a fighter-sized
target, varying slightly with target size. Notably, the missile will revert to
SARH mode if no target is detected if selected for active launch in a SARH mode.</p>
<h2 id="missile-preparation"><a class="header" href="#missile-preparation">Missile Preparation</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-54 missile preparation is started by selecting the MSL PREP switch on
the pilot ACM panel or by activating the ACM. This enables power and cooling to
the missile and also starts the built-in tests in the missile (BIT).</p>
<p>As with the AIM-7, the AIM-54 is tuned before launch using a transmitter on the
rear end of the missile rail, transmitting to the rear receiver of the missile.
The whole missile preparation cycle is completed after around 2 minutes, at
which time the AIM-54 missiles are indicated ready in the corresponding missile
status windows on the pilot ACM.</p>
<h2 id="launch-modes"><a class="header" href="#launch-modes">Launch Modes</a></h2>
<p>The seeker head used in the AIM-54 is capable of both semi-active radar homing
(SARH) and active radar homing (ARH).</p>
<p>Normally, the launch to eject (LTE) cycle of the missile is 3 seconds, meaning
the time from trigger depression to missile ejection. The exception is the ACM
active mode, where the LTE is shortened to 1 second if within 15° from ADL.</p>
<h3 id="tws-sarharh"><a class="header" href="#tws-sarharh">TWS SARH/ARH</a></h3>
<p>In TWS, the AN/AWG-9 is capable of supporting the launch of up to 6 AIM-54
missiles against 6 different targets concurrently. In the first stage of the
AIM-54 engagement, the missile is guided semi-actively by the AN/AWG-9 radar
using both guidance commands transmitted via the radar and radar energy
reflected off the target. Then, when the missile is within range of its seeker’s
ARH mode, the AN/AWG-9 commands the missile to switch to ARH.</p>
<p>Absence of this command via the AN/AWG-9 radar means that the missile won’t
switch to the ARH mode. The AN/AWG-9, however, continues to transmit guidance
commands to the missile as a fallback in case the missile can’t acquire the
target autonomously. This means that the AIM-54 isn’t a “fire and forget”
missile per se, but it can be considered autonomous after transfer to ARH.</p>
<h3 id="pd-stt-sarh"><a class="header" href="#pd-stt-sarh">PD STT SARH</a></h3>
<p>In pulse doppler STT, the AIM-54 uses SARH all the way to the target, receiving
guidance commands at a greater rate than in TWS and also continuous spotlighting
of the target because of the STT mode being used. This increases the effective
range of the AIM-54 seeker slightly.</p>
<h3 id="active-radar-homing-arh"><a class="header" href="#active-radar-homing-arh">Active-Radar Homing (ARH)</a></h3>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_msloptionph.jpg" alt="Active-Radar Homing" /></p>
<p>The AIM-54 can also be commanded to go active directly after launch in both TWS
and pulse doppler STT modes by setting the MSL OPTIONS switch to PH ACT before
launch. This tells the WCS to immediately command the AIM-54 to go active in the
first guidance command after launch. If launched at a target within 6 NM in the
target's rear hemisphere or 10 NM in its forward hemisphere, the WCS will also
automatically command this mode instead of a SARH mode.</p>
<p>If the target is not detected actively by the seeker, it will still fall back to
SARH until the seeker can acquire on its own, like in the two SARH modes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Setting the MSL OPTIONS switch to PH ACT with an AIM-54 in the air will not
make it go active; the PH ACT option can only be set before missile launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="acm-active"><a class="header" href="#acm-active">ACM Active</a></h3>
<p>The last mode is ACM active, in which the missile is commanded active before
launch, making this the only mode where the missile is truly fire and forget.
The AIM-54 missile receives the active message before launch from the WCS in
addition to a command pre-positioning the seeker head to have it look at the
current WCS track if available.</p>
<p>ACM active is commanded when BRSIT (boresight) is selected on the pilot ACM
panel, when having the ACM active without a WCS track, and when using a
non-pulse doppler radar mode or TCS track. When using boresight or ACM without a
track, the missile will launch along the ADL, locking onto the first target seen
while launching at a non-pulse doppler radar track, the seeker head will be
pre-positioned onto that track.</p>
<h2 id="ecm-mode"><a class="header" href="#ecm-mode">ECM Mode</a></h2>
<p>In all of the guidance modes, the seeker head automatically switches to a
passive ECM follow if jammed, angle-tracking the target until it can again track
the target using SARH or ARH. This is done without crew action and is not
indicated to the operator.</p>
<h2 id="missile-operation"><a class="header" href="#missile-operation">Missile Operation</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-54 missile is selected with the weapon selector on the pilot stick by
selecting the SP/PH (sparrow/phoenix) position and then depressing the selector
to switch from SP to PH. It is possible to switch back to SP by again depressing
the weapon selector.</p>
<p>When used in boresight or ACM without a WCS track, the HUD will not indicate any
symbology apart from the ADL, which is used to aim the missile.</p>
<p>When selected with a WCS track in STT, the HUD will display the Target
Designator, and if a TCS track exists, the Movable Reticle overlaying the
target, the former indicating WCS track and the latter TCS line of sight. The
range scale on the right side of the HUD indicates range to target and Rmin and
Rmax, while the VDI, DDD, and TID display the attack guidance symbology.</p>
<h3 id="tws"><a class="header" href="#tws">TWS</a></h3>
<p>When using the AIM-54 with TWS, the WCS automatically prioritizes the tracked
targets, giving them a firing order number indicating missile launch order. As
the first target is launched at, the first track’s number is removed, and the
other tracks’ numbers are decreased by one.</p>
<p>To continue to engage tracks 2 through 6, the pilot depresses the trigger once
for each target, waits until the missile is clear, and then depresses the
trigger again for the next missile, and so on until the desired number of
missiles are away.</p>
<p>After missile launch, the prioritization numbers on the right side of the
targeted tracks are replaced with the TTI or Time to Impact number, showing
calculated time until missile hits the target.</p>
<p>Additionally, when the AN/AWG-9 has sent the active command to the missile, the
TTI numbers blink, indicating that the missile targeting the track has been
commanded to active mode. When this happens depends on the setting of the TGTS
switch on the DDD. SMALL equals 6NM, NORM equals 10NM, and LARGE equals 13NM.
The setting set before launch is used.</p>
<p>The targets currently under missile attack brighten until estimated time to
target plus 15 seconds has elapsed, and when at 15 seconds past estimated time
to the last target, the break-away cross is also displayed on the VDI, DDD, and
TID.</p>
<p>For more info regarding the applicable TID symbology, see TID Symbology.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_TWS.jpg" alt="TWS" /></p>
<p>It is possible to force the WCS to include a target by setting it to mandatory
attack using the CAP and also to exclude a target by setting it to do not attack
on the same panel. In addition, it is possible to command the WCS to set a track
as priority 1 in the firing order by hooking it and pressing NEXT LAUNCH on the
RIO armament panel.</p>
<p>If not already in TWS AUTO, the WCS automatically switches to this mode, thus
assuming control over the AN/AWG-9 radar to keep the engaged targets
illuminated. In addition to the track numbering, the TID also displays a
steering centroid indicating the center weight of the TWS scan pattern.</p>
<p>The HUD and VDI display a steering cue guiding the pilot towards optimal target
illumination and also display range and Rmin and Rmax to target number 1. The
TID displays the complete attack symbology with target prioritization numbers
and individual optimum launch ranges. For more info, see Track While Scan (TWS).</p>
<h2 id="aim-54-in-dcs"><a class="header" href="#aim-54-in-dcs">AIM-54 in DCS</a></h2>
<p>The HB DCS F-14 includes custom AIM-54A and AIM-54C missiles, the AIM-54A with a
choice of two different rocket motors. The aerodynamics and engine performance
for these missiles have been extensively researched and computer simulated to
make the included missiles behave as realistically as possible in regards to
aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Regarding missile seeker and flight profile, we’ve worked with Eagle Dynamics to
enable our F-14 AN/AWG-9 to control the AIM-54 to a degree. In DCS, this means
the following:</p>
<p>In TWS, the missiles will fly out using guidance from the AN/AWG-9 until about
16 seconds to impact, at which time the AN/AWG-9 will tell the missile to go
active if it’s still within the radar scan zone. The exact distance at which the
AN/AWG-9 sends the ATC depends on the setting of the TGTS switch, as detailed
above. This results in a silent engagement until the missiles go active, at
which time the target’s radar warning receiver will get an indication of an
active missile engaging it. If fired at range, the AIM-54 will loft for greater
range. Setting the different seeker activation ranges impacts the amount of
warning the target will get but also the amount of time the missile needs to be
supported.</p>
<p>In PD-STT (Pulse-Doppler Single Target Track), the AIM-54 will be launched in a
pure semi-active mode and be guided in that mode all the way to the target
without going active. This means that the engaged target will get an immediate
engagement warning through its radar warning receiver from the AN/AWG-9 as soon
as the AIM-54 leaves the rail. Like in TWS, the missile will loft if fired at
range.</p>
<p>For all other modes and within 10NM of the target (or in ACM or PH ACT), the
AIM-54 will launch active off the rail, and the targeted aircraft will
immediately see the missile’s own radar actively engaging it. It will not loft
in this case, and thus the range is less than in the other two cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AIM-54C in DCS currently is not affected by the Target Size Switch.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aim-7-sparrow"><a class="header" href="#aim-7-sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_aim-7.jpg" alt="AIM-7 Sparrow" /> <em>U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s
Mate 3rd Class Joshua Karsten. (041108-N-8704K-008)</em></p>
<p>The AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile is a supersonic boost-glide missile capable
of engaging both aircraft and missiles in all weather conditions. The AIM-7
Sparrow missile is a medium-range air-to-air missile with a max range of at
least 16 NM (30 km) for the AIM-7E and at least 38 NM (70 km) for the AIM-7F and
AIM-7M. The all-weather capability comes from the missile being radar-guided,
more exactly SARH (semi-active radar homing). This means that the seeker of the
Sparrow relies on the AN/AWG-9 painting the targets for it and following the
radar emissions being reflected off the target.</p>
<p>The F-14 can carry the AIM-7E, AIM-7F, and AIM-7M on four dedicated recesses on
the aircraft fuselage and one each on the glove pylons.</p>
<p>Apart from the various improvements to the missile range, seeker, and warhead,
the major difference between the different versions is that the AIM-7F and newer
missiles can also be guided via pulse doppler illumination in addition to CW as
opposed to only CW.</p>
<h2 id="missile-preparation-1"><a class="header" href="#missile-preparation-1">Missile Preparation</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_mslprep.jpg" alt="Missile Preparation" /></p>
<p>Before launch, the AIM-7 missiles need to be prepared by the selection of the
MSL PREP-ON pushbutton on the pilot ACM panel. This commands the WCS to start
missile preparation for the AIM-7 and AIM-54.</p>
<p>In the case of the AIM-7, the WCS applies electrical power to the missile to
pre-heat the electronics and gyros. It also injects CW radar video from the
radar to the missiles via an emitter on the aft end of the rail to a receiver at
the aft end of the missile. This video is used to tune the AIM-7 missile to the
selected CW frequency on the RIO DDD panel. When the individual missiles are
tuned and ready, the corresponding missile status windows turn white to indicate
a ready missile.</p>
<h2 id="launch-modes-1"><a class="header" href="#launch-modes-1">Launch Modes</a></h2>
<p>The two available launch modes for the AIM-7 on the F-14 are the normal mode and
the boresight mode. To select the AIM-7 for launch, the pilot selects the SP/PH
(sparrow/phoenix) position on the stick weapon selector. Selection of which
Sparrow to launch is done automatically by the WCS.</p>
<p>Depression of the weapon selector switches from SP to PH and vice versa. If an
STT target is available, the WCS will automatically use the normal mode for
launch unless BRSIT (boresight) is selected on the MSL MODE (missile mode)
switch on the ACM panel. In all other cases, the boresight mode will be used.</p>
<h3 id="normal-mode"><a class="header" href="#normal-mode">Normal Mode</a></h3>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_msloptionsp.jpg" alt="Missile Options" /></p>
<p>As the normal mode is used to engage a target tracked in STT, the WCS is capable
of using both CW and pulse doppler for guidance. When using CW in the normal
mode, the AN/AWG-9 radar uses a dedicated CW antenna to spotlight the tracked
target more directly than via the flood antenna. While CW is the normal guidance
mode for all AIM-7 variants, it is possible to select the pulse doppler guidance
mode instead when using the AIM-7F and AIM-7M missiles.</p>
<p>This is done on the RIO's armament panel with the MSL OPTIONS switch by setting
it to SP DP (sparrow doppler). When selected, this causes the WCS to guide the
Sparrow missiles using pulse doppler illumination instead.</p>
<p>Regardless of guidance mode, the WCS calculates the missile LAR (launch
acceptance region) and displays the missile launch ranges on the VDI and TID.
The HUD shows the target diamond and current target range, Rmin and Rmax, while
the VDI, DDD, and TID display the attack guidance symbology as well as the
above-mentioned missile LAR indications.</p>
<h3 id="boresight-mode"><a class="header" href="#boresight-mode">Boresight Mode</a></h3>
<p>The boresight mode uses the CW flood antenna on the AN/AWG-9 radar and will
cause the missile to track the strongest target return within the flood area. In
addition to when launched in boresight mode, the radar will also switch to flood
mode when a target is lost, either before launch or after launch, enabling the
pilot to try and save the shot by keeping the target within the flood area.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_cwflood.jpg" alt="CW Flood" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aim-9-sidewinder"><a class="header" href="#aim-9-sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_aim-9.jpg" alt="AIM-9" /> <em>U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s Mate Airman Kristopher
Wilson. (050112-N-5345W-066)</em></p>
<p>The AIM-9 Sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile. It uses an infrared seeker locking on to a
target's IR signature, making it capable of tracking a target both during daytime and at night.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat is capable of carrying all Navy versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder from the AIM-9D up
to the AIM-9M. The Heatblur F-14 Tomcat is currently modeled as carrying the AIM-9L and AIM-9M.</p>
<p>The F-14 is capable of carrying the AIM-9 on stations 1A &amp; B and 8A &amp; B. Stations 1 &amp; 8 are the
glove pylons, which can each carry two AIM-9s for a total of 4. Station 1A &amp; 8A are dedicated to
carry only the AIM-9 and are normally used when only carrying two to allow station 1B &amp; 8B to carry
other munitions.</p>
<h2 id="missile-preparation-2"><a class="header" href="#missile-preparation-2">Missile Preparation</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_swcool.jpg" alt="Missile Preparation" /></p>
<p>The cooling of the AIM-9 seeker head needs to be enabled before launch. This is done by pressing the
SW COOL switch on the pilot ACM panel or by selecting the ACM mode on the same panel. This commands
cooling of the missile's seeker head. The missile will immediately show ready, but full seeker head
performance will take at least 60 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="seeker-head-modes"><a class="header" href="#seeker-head-modes">Seeker Head Modes</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-9G introduced a seeker head capable of the Sidewinder expanded acquisition mode (SEAM), and
all later Sidewinders carried by the F-14 are also capable of that mode. SEAM allows the missile
seeker head to be uncaged to track a target within the seeker limits (40° from ADL), allowing the
pilot to lead the target, improving missile performance. It also allows for the WCS on the F-14 to
slave the seeker to a tracked target within 20° from ADL, allowing for off-boresight acquisition.</p>
<p>The AIM-9 on the F-14 can still use the old boresight mode where the seeker head remains slaved to
ADL (2.5° field of view), but normally SEAM is used to scan the seeker about either ADL or a tracked
target. This scan is not visible to the pilot and is done to increase effective seeker head field of
view. As with all Sidewinders, target detection is indicated by an aural tone. That growling tone is
present while scanning but increases in intensity while the seeker is looking at an IR source.</p>
<h2 id="missile-operation-1"><a class="header" href="#missile-operation-1">Missile Operation</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-9 Sidewinder is selected for launch with the weapon selector on the pilot stick. The weapon
selector can be used to cycle which AIM-9 is selected for launch by depressing it, indicating on the
ACM panel which missile is selected by a checkerboard indication in the corresponding status window.
When using the AIM-9, the HUD uses the diamond to indicate a tracked target and the pipper
(crosshair) to indicate current seeker head position. If a WCS track with range is available, the
HUD also displays range to target and Rmin and Rmax. The VDI, DDD, and TID display the attack
guidance symbology if a WCS track is present.</p>
<p>The basic missile boresight mode without SEAM (no scan) is commanded by depressing the BRSIT
(boresight) switch on the pilot ACM panel while not having the ACM mode active. In this mode, the
pilot puts the target at ADL and fires when the aural tone is present.</p>
<p>If the BRSIT switch is not used or the ACM mode is active, the AIM-9 will use the SEAM and set the
missile to use a scan pattern around the ADL. If a WCS target is present, the seeker head will scan
around the radar or TCS line of sight; otherwise, the missile will scan around the ADL.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/weapons_seamlock.jpg" alt="SEAM Lock" /></p>
<p>To enable lock-on to a target in SEAM, the pilot depresses the CAGE/SEAM pushbutton on the left
throttle. This illuminates the SEAM LOCK light on the ACM panel and un-cages the seeker for 4.5
seconds, allowing it to track a target present in the seeker's field of view. If no IR source is
found, the missile is again caged and the SEAM LOCK light is deactivated.</p>
<p>If lock-on is successful, the aural tone will remain and the SEAM LOCK light stays illuminated,
allowing the pilot to launch the missile by pressing the stick trigger. After launch, the next AIM-9
will automatically be selected.</p>

folding-fin aircraft rocket (FFAR).</p>
<p>As the F-14’s combat role changed to include the precision ground attack mission
it was also cleared to carry several of the guided bomb unit (GBU) versions of
the Mk-80 series bombs, more specifically, some of the laser guided versions.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/weapons_armamentpanel.jpg" alt="Armament Panel" /></p>
<p>The air-to-ground weapon delivery is set up by the RIO on his armament panel on
the left vertical panel of the RIO cockpit.</p>
<p>The type of munition for delivery is set up by the wheel on the top of the
panel, turning it to the correct munition. This configures the WCS with the
correct parameters for the selected munition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The Mk-81, 82, and 83 have both an L and an H option for low-drag and
high-drag versions, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under <strong>DLVY MODE</strong> (delivery mode), it is possible to set STP/RPL (step/ripple)
and SGL/PRS (single/pairs). The possible combinations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STP and SGL</strong>: Releases one store with each depression of the bomb release
button on the pilot stick.</li>
<li><strong>STP and PRS</strong>: As with STP and SGL but each depression of the bomb release
button on the pilot stick releases a pair of stores. Only works for paired
stations, 1 with 8, 3 with 6, and 4 with 5.</li>
<li><strong>RPL and SGL</strong>: Used with all attack modes, each depression of the bomb
release button on the pilot stick releases a set amount of stores set by the
<strong>QTY</strong> (quantity) wheels with the interval set by the <strong>INTERVAL</strong> wheels (in
milliseconds).</li>
<li><strong>RPL and PRS</strong>: As RPL and SGL but each release pulse releases a pair of
stores, <strong>QTY</strong> still sets the total amount of stores to be released.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>MECH FUSE</strong> switch sets which mechanical fuse to arm on the stores.
<strong>NOSE</strong> arms the nose fuse, <strong>SAFE</strong> inhibits arming of the fuses, and
<strong>NOSE/TAIL</strong> arms both fuses.</p>
<p>The <strong>ELEC FUSE</strong> selector knob sets the electrical fuse of the store to be
released:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAFE</strong>: Inhibits electrical bomb fusing.</li>
<li><strong>VT</strong>: Sets air-burst mode at preset burst height for compatible stores.</li>
<li><strong>INST</strong>: Sets instantaneous burst mode.</li>
<li><strong>DLY 1</strong>: Sets preset time delay 1.</li>
<li><strong>DLY 2</strong>: Sets preset time delay 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>INTERVAL</strong> and <strong>QTY</strong> (quantity) wheels set the release interval (in
milliseconds) and quantity of stores to be released, compatible with the
delivery modes as seen above under <strong>DLVY MODE</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <strong>6 STA SEL</strong> (station select) switches set which pylons to use for
store delivery (also used for selection of what stores to jettison). To select a
pylon for store delivery, set the corresponding switch to <strong>SEL</strong>. Stations 1
and 8 should be set to <strong>B</strong> for selection, <strong>SW</strong> was used to jettison AIM-9
Sidewinders but is now inoperable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 All F-14 bombs in DCS are assumed to have both types of fuzes, so both the
mechanical and electrical fuze need to be set. GBUs, Mk-20s, and Mk-81 to 84s
need the mechanical fuze set to either <strong>N</strong> or <strong>N/T</strong> settings, the Mk-82AIR
(ballute) and Mk-82 Snake-Eye can be dropped in free-fall with <strong>N</strong> and
retarded with <strong>N/T</strong>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="air-to-ground-weapon-delivery"><a class="header" href="#air-to-ground-weapon-delivery">Air-to-Ground Weapon Delivery</a></h1>
<p>Air-to-ground delivery is initiated by pilot selection of the <strong>A/G</strong> mode on
the display control panel. After tape read-in (about 30 seconds), the WCS
initiates the air-to-ground mode and enables relevant symbology on the displays.</p>
<p>The weapon selection automatically switches to ordnance (<strong>ORD</strong> on the HUD)
unless the pilot has selected another weapon. All other options are set by the
RIO in the back seat.</p>
<p>The available attack modes in the F-14 are set by the <strong>ATTK MODE</strong> selector in
the RIO pit and are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CMPTR TGT</strong>: Computer target, a semi-automatic computer-guided mode similar
to a CCRP mode in newer aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>CMPTR IP</strong>: Computer initial point, an extended CMPTR TGT mode using a known
initial point (IP) as a reference for store delivery. Mostly used in
situations where the actual target is expected to be hard to locate visually
and is located closely to an easily identifiable reference point/landmark.</li>
<li><strong>CMPTR PLT</strong>: Computer pilot, a manual computer and pilot-guided mode using
the WCS for store impact point indication on HUD. Similar to a CCIP mode in
newer aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>MAN</strong>: Manual, manual backup mode in which the HUD displays a pipper
(crosshair) on the HUD at the deflection set by the pilot. Used in case of a
systems failure prohibiting the other modes.</li>
<li><strong>D/L BOMB</strong>: Data-link bomb, an automatic mode in which the pilot is steered
via data-link cues for remotely controlled store delivery. (Not implemented in
DCS at this point in time.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="computer-target"><a class="header" href="#computer-target">Computer Target</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/weapons_cmptrtgt.jpg" alt="Computer Target" /></p>
<p>The computer target mode allows the pilot to designate a target onto which the
WCS then guides the pilot towards store release. This mode is usable for all
air-to-ground stores, including rockets.</p>
<p>When selected, the HUD displays the diamond as target designator and the bomb
fall line (BFL) through the velocity vector and store impact point pipper
(crosshair).</p>
<p>To designate a target, the pilot steers the aircraft in azimuth to place the
target along the BFL. Then <strong>UP/DN</strong> on the target designate switch on the left
wall of the pilot cockpit is used to slew the target designator along the BFL
until it overlays the target. At that point, the target is designated by
pressing the target designate switch to <strong>DES</strong>.</p>
<p>After designation, the target designation diamond becomes stabilized to the
designated position on the ground, and the AN/AWG-9 is slewed to it for range
measurements. The BFL now remains overlaying the designated target while the
store impact point pipper and aircraft velocity vector continue to follow
aircraft movements. In addition, the HUD now displays the upper and lower
solution cues on the BFL.</p>
<p>The pilot should now fly the velocity vector and store impact point over the BFL
until the solution cues reach them. The lower solution cue indicates imminent
store release when passing the velocity vector, and the pilot should by now be
holding the bomb release button depressed to authorize WCS store release. When
the upper solution cue reaches the velocity vector, the WCS automatically
releases set stores on the condition that the bomb release button is depressed.</p>
<p>The pull-up cue (bracket on the HUD) moves upwards on the HUD towards the
velocity vector with decreasing altitude. When it reaches the velocity vector,
it indicates that the aircraft is below safe altitude for store release.</p>
<h2 id="computer-initial-point"><a class="header" href="#computer-initial-point">Computer Initial Point</a></h2>
<p>Functionally identical to the Computer Target mode except that a preset initial
point (IP) is designated instead of the actual target. The IP is preset before
takeoff using data-link or manually by the RIO using the CAP.</p>
<p>The IP waypoint should be a terrain feature expected to be visually identifiable
by the pilot even if the target is not.</p>
<p>To set the CAP, the RIO designates the location of the IP waypoint as per the
other waypoints in the system. (See CAP heading under AN/AWG-9 in the General
Design and Systems Overview section or the Navigation Systems heading in the
same section)</p>
<p>The message (function) <strong>IP TO TGT</strong> on the CAP under the SPL category is then
used with the prefixes <strong>ALT</strong>, <strong>RNG</strong>, and <strong>BRG</strong> to read out and set the
following data points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALT</strong>: Sets altitude difference of the target relative to the IP waypoint.</li>
<li><strong>RNG</strong>: Sets range to target from the IP waypoint.</li>
<li><strong>BRG</strong>: Sets the bearing to the target from the IP waypoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the pilot designates the IP visually on the HUD, the WCS recalculates the
target location using the data set under the <strong>IP TO TGT</strong> function on the CAP,
moves the target diamond to that location, and instead displays guidance towards
the real target location.</p>
<p>All other functions of this mode are identical to the Computer Target mode.</p>
<h2 id="computer-pilot"><a class="header" href="#computer-pilot">Computer Pilot</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/weapons_cmptrpilot.jpg" alt="Computer Pilot" /></p>
<p>The computer pilot mode uses the WCS to continually calculate and display an
impact point for the configured store on the HUD.</p>
<p>When selected, the HUD displays the current store impact point in real-time
using the pipper (crosshair). The target designation diamond is used when the
WCS is configured for rockets and overlays the pipper to indicate that the
configured store is out of range when displayed. As in the Computer Target and
IP modes, the pull-up cue is used to indicate aircraft below safe store release
altitude when at or above the velocity vector.</p>
<p>To correctly engage the desired target, the pilot flies the impact point pipper
on the HUD over the target and then depresses the bomb release button.</p>
<p>When using rockets, the pilot should wait until the diamond disappears,
indicating that the selected store is within range and then use the control
stick trigger to fire the rockets.</p>
<h2 id="manual"><a class="header" href="#manual">Manual</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/weapons_man.jpg" alt="Manual" /></p>
<p>The manual air-to-ground mode is used as a backup when the other modes are
unavailable.</p>
<p>By principle, it works the same as the Computer Pilot mode in that the pilot
should fly the pipper on the HUD over the desired target. The pipper is in this
mode not updated by the WCS, however, but instead set at a deflection from the
ADL according to desired engagement speed, dive angle, and release altitude.</p>
<p>This is set using the elevation lead panel on the pilot right side vertical
panel using weapon engagement tables or by pilot estimation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="zuni-rockets"><a class="header" href="#zuni-rockets">Zuni Rockets</a></h1>
<p>The Zuni 5-inch folding-fin aircraft rocket (FFAR) was developed to replace the
high-velocity aircraft rocket (HVAR) of World War 2 vintage. As part of its
design, it’s modular and capable of using different warheads as well as
different fuzes.</p>
<p>The Zuni rockets are carried in LAU-10 pods, each carrying 4 rockets. The pods
can fire in either salvo mode or ripple mode, salvo launching one rocket and
ripple all.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat can carry LAU-10 rocket pods on stations 1B, 3, 6, and 8B using
TERs, each TER holding up to two pods except one of either 3 or 6 which must
only carry one as not to clash with a pod on the adjacent station. The TERs are
used to gain separation from the station for safe rocket firing, and the reason
for not being able to use three pods on the TERs is that on the glove pylons,
the inner TER station would conflict with the main landing gear and on stations
3 and 6 with the fuselage.</p>
<p>The Zuni rockets are set up for launch by the RIO on the armament panel as with
bombs, the delivery mode (<strong>DLVY MODE</strong>) switches being used to configure how
many pods to activate at a time.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/weapons_dumb.jpg" alt="Mk-80 Series Bombs" /> <em>U.S. Navy photo by
Photographer’s Mate Airman Justin S. Osborne. (030321-N-0382O-506)</em></p>
<p>The Mk-80 series bombs are the standard general-purpose bombs used by the US
Navy and allies and were first dropped in combat during the Vietnam War. The
Mk-82 also has the capability to mount a retardation system using either folding
fins or an inflated ballute to brake the bomb after release, allowing them to be
dropped at lower altitudes as the dropping aircraft has more time to move away
from them. Those versions are called the Mk-82 Snake Eye (fins) and Mk-82AIR
(ballute) in DCS.</p>
<p>The F-14 is capable of carrying all the various bombs in the Mk-80s series, 81
through to 84. While the ground attack mission never really materialized for the
F-14 in the Navy, it was tested for and cleared to deliver these weapons from
the start.</p>
<p>The F-14 uses the Phoenix rails (stations 3-6) and the glove pylons’ lower
stations to mount the bombs. The rails themselves can carry all four variants
while the 81 to 83 can also be mounted on substations along the sides of the
Phoenix rails as well as on TERs on the glove pylons.</p>
<p>All of the Mk-80 bombs have nose fuzes only and should be dropped with the nose
(N) fuze setting on the mechanical fuze switch on the RIO armament panel. The
Mk-82AIR and Snake Eye variants use the tail fuze wire to enable bomb
retardation, meaning that the nose/tail (N/T) mechanical fuze option should be
used if retardation is needed.</p>
<p>The total amount of the different bombs carried depends on weapon weight and
weapon clearance between the rails; the actual number varies from 18 for the 81s
and 82s to just 4 for the 84s as those can only be mounted on the rails
themselves. For more info, see the F-14 loadout diagrams.</p>

<p>The GBU (guided bomb unit) are bombs from the Mk-80s series with an attached
seeker unit and fin (control) unit converting them into guided precision bombs,
and in the case of the GBU-10, 12, 16, and 24 carried by the F-14, laser-guided
bombs to be more precise.</p>
<p>When the F-14B gained the ability to mount and use the LANTIRN pod, it was also
cleared to carry some of the GBU variants of the Mk-80 series bombs. It can
either deliver them onto designation from a self-carried LANTIRN pod or onto a
laser designation from another aircraft or ground source.</p>
<p>The GBUs carried are mounted on the Phoenix rails themselves on stations 3-6 as
the additional size of a GBU compared to a normal Mk-80 series bomb makes it
impossible to use the substations on the rails for those. Each station is
capable of carrying one GBU up to the size of the GBU-16. As for the GBU-10 and
24, the 10 can be carried on the front rails (3 and 6) and the 24 on one front
rail and one back rail as they need to be carried on opposite sides of the
aircraft due to the larger wing assembly.</p>

<p>The Mk-20 Rockeye is a conventional free-fall bomb like the Mk-80 series bombs,
but instead of a conventional charge, it carries anti-tank submunitions. The
Rockeye contains 247 of these anti-tank submunitions, which are released at a
set height using a radar altimeter, the design being that the submunitions are
dispersed over a large area for greater effect.</p>
<p>The fuze height itself is set by the ground crew as they’re loaded and can’t be
changed by the pilot. To arm the Rockeye correctly, the mechanical fuse should
be set to nose (N).</p>
<p>The F-14 can carry up to 10 Mk-20 Rockeyes using the Phoenix rails and
substations as well as TERs on the glove pylons.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jester AI</strong> aims to be a functional AI Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) for
the Heatblur DCS F-14, enabling a multi-crew experience in a single-player (per
aircraft) environment.</p>
<p>He is fully integrated into the rear cockpit, controlling nearly all back seat
systems, with a focus on systems not controllable from the pilot seat. He is
also modeled to simulate human limitations—his head position, visual spotting
range, and hand positions are all accounted for. When controlling systems at the
RIO seat, he performs all actions a human RIO would.</p>
<p>To control Jester, a <strong>command wheel</strong> is used for quick access. This wheel is
dynamic based on the selected mode and the current situation. Feedback to the
pilot is given via ICS using a library of recorded audio, simulating a RIO
actually talking. In addition to acknowledging orders, Jester will provide
pertinent information based on the situation.</p>
<p>In multiplayer, if a human RIO disconnects mid-flight, Jester resumes control of
the rear cockpit systems in the configuration left by the human player.</p>
<h3 id="functionality"><a class="header" href="#functionality">Functionality</a></h3>
<p><img src="jester_iceman/../img/jester_menu.jpg" alt="Menu" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Jester menu</strong> is opened by default with the <kbd>A</kbd> key. Selection of
items (<num>1</num>–<num>8</num>) is done using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>
through <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>8</kbd>. These controls can be remapped under the
<strong>Jester</strong> category in the <strong>F-14 Pilot</strong> DCS key-binds. The menu system is
designed to support 8-way hat switch mapping. Optionally, you can use your
viewing angle in the cockpit to select menu petals by holding the Jester menu
key for over 0.5 seconds - this can be toggled in the F-14 options.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first press brings up a <strong>contextual menu</strong> based on current aircraft mode
and situation.</li>
<li>A second press opens the <strong>Main Menu</strong>.</li>
<li>A third press closes the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air-to-Air mode (airborne)</strong>: opens <em>Beyond Visual Range – Radar</em> menu.</li>
<li><strong>Air-to-Ground mode</strong>: opens <em>Air-to-Ground – Weapons</em> menu.</li>
<li><strong>Take-off/Landing</strong>: context-specific menus available.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these menus, pilots can control RIO systems. Menu contents can change based
on prior selections. In some cases, menu petals act as inputs/keypads for
entering data like frequencies or waypoints.</p>
<p>You can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a <strong>waypoint</strong> from an F10 map marker (menu shows time and name).</li>
<li>Lock targets on the <strong>TID</strong> using options like <em>closest target</em> or <em>specific
azimuth/range</em>.</li>
<li>Run a <strong>startup checklist</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assisted-startup"><a class="header" href="#assisted-startup">Assisted Startup</a></h3>
<p><img src="jester_iceman/../img/jester_startup.jpg" alt="Startup" /></p>
<p>For aircraft cold start, Jester can either perform his checklist like a real RIO
would, or he can also help the pilot with an assisted startup in which he reads
the pilot's checklist to him while starting.</p>
<p>To access the normal, unassisted startup, select startup, Jester will then go
through his checklist. He will at times ask the pilot if he has completed
certain checks or ask for specific tests, this is answered via the Jester menu
using the options appearing there. As an example he will start by asking for a
comms check which is answered via the Jester menu. Note that after engine
startup and EMERG GEN Master test he will ask for what INS alignment to go for,
select this via the Jester menu as well.</p>
<p>To access the assisted startup select assisted start on the Jester menu. Jester
will now read out the checklist to the pilot and highlight the relevant
indicators and switches during startup. Use the Jester menu to tell Jester when
a check/step is complete.</p>
