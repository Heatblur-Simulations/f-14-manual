# Engines & Fuel Systems

Depending on the variant, the F-14 Tomcat is either equipped with two Pratt &
Whitney TF30-P-414A or two General Electrics F110-GE-400 turbofan
[engines](engines.md).

Each engine is fed by an independent [fuel system](fuel_system.md) from fuel
tanks installed in the airframe.
