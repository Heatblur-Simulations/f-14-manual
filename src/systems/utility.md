## Oxygen System

The F-14 carries one or two 10-liter liquid oxygen bottles providing oxygen to the crew when needed.

The oxygen supply is controlled on the pilot Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control Panel and RIO Oxygen-Vent
Airflow Control Panel respectively. Both panels contain an OXYGEN switch that sets oxygen supply to
ON or OFF.

Liquid oxygen remaining is shown on the Liquid Oxygen Quantity Indicator on the pilot’s right side
console. The gauge shows remaining liters of liquid oxygen up to 20 liters (if two bottles are
installed). The indicator is electrically driven and if it receives no power an OFF flag will be
visible and it will display 0 liters remaining.

Additionally the RIO Caution-Advisory Panel has the OXY LOW caution light which illuminates when the
liquid oxygen quantity is below 2 liters.

During the INST test on the ref:MTPanel the liquid oxygen meter shows 2 liters and the OXY LOW
caution light illuminates.

## Canopy

The rear-hinged F-14 canopy is operated hydraulically and pneumatically. Controls are present in
both the pilot and RIO cockpits.

See Canopy Control Handle or Canopy Control Handle for the controls.

The CANOPY caution light on both the Pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator and the RIO Caution-Advisory
Panel illuminates if the canopy is not in the down and locked, secured position.
