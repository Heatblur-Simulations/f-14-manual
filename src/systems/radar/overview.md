# AN/AWG-9 Radar

The AN/AWG-9 radar in the F-14 is an all-weather, multi-mode pulse doppler radar
using the X-band (X-band being 8-12 GHz). It was designed specifically to be a
long range radar system capable of guiding up to 6 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles using
its track while scan mode. One originally envisioned scenario was its use as a
long range fleet defender intercepting russian bombers and attack aircraft
threatening the fleet. During the F-14’s later service life this mission
transitioned more towards the anti-fighter side, a mission for which it was very
well adapted.
