# AN/AWG-9 Radar

> 🚧 TODO: Create an overview similar to the F-4's APQ-120 overview. Add more indepth sections
> overall for the radar's operation in A/A. Below paragraph is ported from the original F-14 manual.

The AN/AWG-9 radar in the F-14 is an all-weather, multi-mode pulse doppler radar using the X-band
(X-band being 8-12 GHz). It was designed specifically to be a long range radar system capable of
guiding up to 6 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles using its track while scan mode. One originally envisioned
scenario was its use as a long range fleet defender intercepting russian bombers and attack aircraft
threatening the fleet. During the F-14’s later service life this mission transitioned more towards
the anti-fighter side, a mission for which it was very well adapted.
