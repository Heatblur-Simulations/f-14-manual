# Lighting System

> 🚧 TODO: Add pictures

The F-14 Tomcat lighting system consists of the internal and the external lights.

The internal lights are the red instrument panel and console lights, red and white floodlights and a
moveable utility light at both crew stations.

The external lights are the position lights, the anticollision lights, the formation lights, the
taxi light, the approach lights and the refueling probe light.

## Internal Lighting

The red instrument panel and console lights are the normally used lights during nighttime, they
back-light all instruments and controls allowing their use while impacting night vision minimally.

The floodlights allow for additional lighting of the cockpit panels but care should be taken to
avoid affecting night vision.

The utility lights are movable and can be used to illuminate a specific spot and as a map or reading
light.

Controls for the internal lights are on the Master Light Control Panel in pilot cockpit and Interior
Light Control Panel in the RIO cockpit, each controlling their own cockpit lighting.

> 💡 The utility light function is not modeled in DCS, but the flashlight function, default
> keybind Left Alt + L, which moves with the cursor, can be used, providing a similar function.

## External Lighting

The position lights on the F-14 are located on the left wing tip (red), right wing tip (green), top
aft of left vertical stabilizer (white) and upper and lower lights on the wing gloves on each side
(red on left glove and green on right). The glove lights are additional lights supplementing the
wing tip lights. When the wings are swept forward of 25° the wing tip lights are active and when aft
of 25° the glove lights are active instead.

With the gear down, wings forward of 25° and the position lights in steady mode both the glove and
wingtip position lights are lit. When the anticollision lights are on the the position lights can
only operate in the steady mode, otherwise they can be set to flash.

The anticollision lights are located on the chin pod or TCS pod, top front of the left vertical
stabilizer and top aft of the right vertical stabilizer. The anticollision lights are all red
flashing lights. The chin pod mounted lower light only operates while the nosegear wheel door is
closed.

The formation lights are dim green lights used for formation flight which can be dimmed gradually.
They are located on the aircraft nose (behind the radome), the wing tips, on the fuselage aft of the
wings and on the top edge of the vertical stabilizers. All are duplicated on both sides of the
aircraft.

The taxi light is a fixed headlight located on the nosewheel strut. It’s automatically turned off
with gear retraction if set to on.

The approach lights are also located on the nosewheel strut and replicate the AoA indexer for the
LSOs during carrier traps.

The refueling probe light is used to illuminate the refueling probe and is automatically enabled
with probe extension.

All external light controls are located on the Master Light Control Panel except for the exterior
lights switch on the left throttle (see Throttle) which disables or enables all external lights
apart from the approach lights.
