# ALR-45/50 (F-14A Early)

> 🚧 TODO: Perhaps elaborate on the system's specifics more.

The AN/ALR-45 and AN/ALR-50 combination was introduced during the early 70s as a response to the
increasingly lethal SAM and AAA systems introduced during that era. It's purpose is to inform the
crew about threats and help them defend against them by indicating reception of threat emissions and
when they pose a threat to the aircraft. Similarly to ALR-67 it's working in cooperaiton with DECM
jammer (ALQ-100).

The AN/ALR-45 has four quadrant receiver antennas located on the front sides of the engine intakes
as well as the trailing outer edges of the stabilators to provide a 360 degree coverage of the
aircraft. It provides a general ECM situational awareness as well as indicating emitters locking
onto and attacking the aircraft.

The AN/ALR-50 is a dedicated missile warning system and has one upper antenna located aft of the
cockpit and another lower antenna located on one of the nose gear doors. The purpose of the
AN/ALR-50 is to detect and warn about possible missile launches. It can identify **MA (missile
alert)** and **ML (missile launch)** conditions for some of the radars which use missile
command-link signals. (Currently in DCS the MA should be interpreted as lock and ML as launch)

Both systems are used as a combined set and can be used to trigger countermeasure program release
from the AN/ALE-39 as well as triggering the DECM into transmission.

The system displays threats on the pilot HSD and the RIO ECMD when they are set to ECM. Via the
display controls the ECM can be allowed to override the current display if a threat is detected.

## Controls

![Control Panel](../../../SphinxManual/Manual/source//images/general/alr-45/control.jpg)

The main **ECM** control panel for the AN/ALR-45 and AN/ALR-50 is located on the RIO's right
horizontal console. The power switch for both system is located on the right side of this control
panel and is labeled **PWR - ALR-45/50** (**5**).

The three three-position switches (**1**, **2** and **3**) on the top control the three operating
bands of the AN/ALR-45 allowing exclusive display of that band or removal of that band from the
displays. The upper position, **BYPASS**, is momentary and holding the switch to that position
allows all signals in that band through regardless of their parameters, normally only those matching
threats are passed through. Holding a band to **BYPASS** removes the other two band from the display
completely though which is why the switch is automatically returned to **NORM** when released. The
**NORM** position allows for normal operation of that band. The lower position, **DEFEAT**, is
locked out and the switch need to be lifted to allow movement to this position. The **DEFEAT**
position completely disables the selected band.

The middle volume knob, **4**, controls the audio levels of the AN/ALR-45 and AN/ALR-50 in the RIO's
headset. The outside part of the knob controls audio from the AN/ALR-45 and can be turned off if
needed. The inside part controls audio from the AN/ALR-50 can't be completely turned off as it
controls the MA/ML tones.

The **AAA** switch (**10**) enables or disables display of strobes relating to AAA threats, the
threat acronym and indicator lights still function. **NORM** allows normal operation and display of
AAA threats and **DEFEAT** disables the strobes.

The **UNKNOWN** switch (**6**) disables display of normal threats and display all unknown signals
not identified as normal threast as solid strobes, the UNK acronym will be display whenever there
are any present. The **DISPLAY** position allows this display and is momentary and needs to be held
and the **OFF** position allows normal AN/ALR-45 operation.

The three test switches (**7**, **8** and **9**) are all spring-loaded to center and allows for
activation of BIT for the selected band or system. The **TEST - LOW/OFF/MID** switch enables BIT of
the AN/ALR-45 **LOW** and **MID** band. The **LOW** position should result in a dotted strobe in
each quadrant as well as audio and associated warning lights and acronyms for AAA and SAM LOW. The
**MID** position should result in a dot-dash strobe in each quadrant as well as audio and associated
warning lights and acronyms for AAA/AI and SAM MID. The **TEST - ML/OFF** switch enables BIT of the
AN/ALR-50 in the **ML** position and should result in flashing SAM lights and range rings on the
display as well as associated audio tones. The **TEST - HIGH/OFF** switch enables BIT of the
AN/ALR-45 high band in the **HIGH** band and should result in a dashed strobe in each of the four
quadrants on the display as well as audio and associated warning lights and acronyms for AI and SAM
HIGH.

The **ECM DISPLAY** control panel is also located on the RIO's right horizontal console. It controls
the RIO's **ECMD** display as well as generic display settings for both displays.

The **ECM - CORR** switch (**1**) allows setting how the two systems correlate their threats. It is
spring-loaded back to **ML**. The **MA/ML** position is a momentary position and allows the RIO to
correlate AN/ALR-50 threats with a **MA** or **ML** condition to a AN/ALR-45 threats. The **ML**
position, which is the normal switch position, sets the ECM to only correlate a AN/ALR-50 threats to
an AN/ALR-45 threats if a **ML** condition occurs. The **OFF** position defeats (disables) the
correlation momentarily allowing for normal uncorrelated threat display.

The **ECM - ORIDE** switch (**2**) controls when the ECM can override the NAV display on the
**ECMD**. The **ML** position allows override if a **ML** condition occurs. The **ML/AI** position
allows override if a **ML** condition occurs or an **AI** (Airborne Intercept, i.e. fighter radar)
is detected. The **OFF** position disables override.

The **MODE** switch (**3**) selects which system to display on the **ECMD**. **ECM** displays the
ECM and **NAV** displays NAV.

The **DATA/ADF** switch (**4**) controls what additional text information to display in the NAV
mode. **BOTH** displays ADF and general navigation information, **DATA** displays only the general
navigation information and **OFF** disables all extra text.

The switch controlling display of ECM information to the pilot is located on the
![Displays Control Panel](../../cockpit/pilot/right_vertical_console.md#displays-control-panel) and
the volume controls are located on the
![Volume/TACAN Command Panel](../../cockpit/pilot/left_console.md#volumetacan-command-panel).

The two crewmembers have warning lights dedicated to specific threats on their front cockpit panels.
The pilot warning lights are situated on the right side of the HUD and the RIO warning lights on the
right side of the TID. The RIO warning light panel also contains lights for the AN/ALQ-100 and the
IFF transponder, those are detailed under their respective section.

The different lights illuminate to indicate the presence of a certain type of threat.

## Threat Indication Alert Tones

There are 3 types of sound produced by ALR-45/50:

- ALR-45 Threat radar caution - depends on radar
- ALR-50 MA (missile alert) tone - low frequency warble
- ALR-50 ML (missile launch) tone - high frequency warble
