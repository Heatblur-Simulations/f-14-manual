**Iceman** is a basic autopilot AI and a subset of the Jester system. It is designed for
singleplayer scenarios where a player may switch between the front and rear seats.

When the player switches to the RIO seat:

- Iceman takes control of heading and altitude.
- The Iceman menu allows setting heading, altitude, and speed—either relative to a target or as
  absolute values.
