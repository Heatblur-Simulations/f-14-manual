### System Status Circle

The upper left quadrant (Area I) can show the following symbols:

- N - Normal
- I - AI, airborne interceptors prioritized.
- A - AAA, anti-air artillery prioritized.
- U - Unknown emitters prioritized.
- F - Friendly emitters shown in addition to other threats.

The upper right quadrant (Area II) can either be blank (limited mode not
selected) or show L if selected. Limited mode will only show the 6 highest
prioritized threats on the display.

The lower half shows system status codes:

- _Blank_ - No failure detected and offset not selected.
- B - BIT failure.
- T - Thermal overload.
- O - Offset display selected. Threats will be separated to allow readout of
  overlapping symbols. Bearing accuracy degraded for displaced threats.
