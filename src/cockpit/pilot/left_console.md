## Throttle Quadrant

| Quadrant                                                   | Schema                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![throttles](../../img/cockpit_detail_pilot_throttles.jpg) | ![throttles-schema](../../img/general_engine_throttles-schem.jpg) |

The throttle quadrant contains the two main engine throttle controls, the flap lever, and the manual
wing-sweep handle, in addition to HOTAS controls on the throttles.

The throttles have detents in the OFF, IDLE, and MIL positions.

Moving the throttles from OFF to IDLE arms ignition and disengages fuel cutoff.

The sideways throttle movements are not spring-loaded, allowing the pilot to rest the throttles at
MIL during catapult launches and preventing accidental spool-down.

A friction lever for throttle movement friction is located on the left side of the throttle quadrant
beneath the flap lever.

The flap lever has a stepless range of motion between up and down and includes two emergency
positions, emergency up and emergency down. Both have detents and require moving the lever outboard
to continue into the emergency range.

Emergency up forces the flaps up, overriding normal flap logic. Emergency down is non-functional.

The manual/emergency wing-sweep handle is guarded and normally stowed. The handle top is extended
for manual operation.

For more information see [Wing-Sweep System](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/wing_sweep.md).

## Hydraulic Hand Pump

The hydraulic hand pump is located inboard of the throttle quadrant near the pilot’s left leg.

It is used to manually build hydraulic pressure for brake operation (with the gear handle down) or
for refueling probe operation in the event of hydraulic system failure.
