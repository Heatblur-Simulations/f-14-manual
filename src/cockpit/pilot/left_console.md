## Throttle Quadrant

| Quadrant                                                   | Schema                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![throttles](../../img/cockpit_detail_pilot_throttles.jpg) | ![throttles-schema](../../img/general_engine_throttles-schem.jpg) |

The main throttle quadrant contains the two main-engine throttle controls, the
flap lever and manual wing-sweep handle in addition to the HOTAS controls on the
throttles themselves. The throttles have detents in the OFF, IDLE and MIL
positions.

Moving the throttles to the IDLE position from OFF arms the ignition and
disengages the fuel cutoff. The sideways movements of the throttles are not
spring loaded, this is so the pilot can have the throttle resting at MIL power
for catapult launches and prevents accidental spool down of the engines. A
friction lever for selection of desired throttle movement friction is located on
the left side of the throttle quadrant, beneath the flap lever.

The flap lever has a stepless range of motion between up and down and has two
emergency positions, one emergency up and one emergency down. Both emergency
positions have detents, the lever needs to be moved outboards to continue
movement into these positions. Emergency up forces the flaps up, overriding the
normal flap logic. Emergency down is non-functional.

The manual/emergency wing-sweep handle is protected by a guard and is normally
pushed in and stowed. The handle-top is extended for manual operation. For more
information see
[Wing-Sweep System](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/wing_sweep.md).

## Hydraulic Hand Pump

The hydraulic hand pump is located inboards of the throttle quadrant, near the
pilot’s left leg. It is used to manually add hydraulic pressure for brake
operation (with gear handle in the down position) or for refueling probe
operation in case of a failure in the hydraulic system.
