# Left Windshield Frame

## Approach Indexer

![Approach Indexer](../../img/cockpit_detail_pilot_aoaindexer.jpg)

Contains three lights showing angle-of-attack (AOA) relative on-speed AOA:

- Green: too slow
- Amber: on-speed AOA
- Red: too fast

If the HOOK BY-PASS switch is set to CARRIER the lights will flash if the
arresting hook is up while the landing gear is down.

These lights are repeated on the approach lights on the nosewheel strut,
allowing the LSO to see aircraft AOA during carrier landings.
