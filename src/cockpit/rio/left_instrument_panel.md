| No. | Control/Indicator         | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Altimeter readout         | Displays altitude digitally on three drums showing 10,000, 1,000, and 100 of feet respectively. It also displays altitude on a pointer on a circular scale indicating 100’s of feet.                                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | Baroset knob              | Sets local pressure in inches of mercury (in.Hg). Only used locally on the altimeter readout, all other digital indicators (via CADC) use a set 29.92 in.Hg value.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | Local Barometric Pressure | Indicates barometric pressure setting, also called the Kollsman Window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4   | Mode switch               | Three-position switch, spring-loaded to return from RESET. If power and altitude data from CADC are present, the switch can be held in RESET for 3 seconds to allow normal (servoed) mode of operation. If set to STBY or power or CADC data is absent for more than 3 seconds the system switches to backup (pressure) mode. |
| 5   | STBY flag                 | Red flag reading STBY that appears if the system is in backup (stand-by) mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Airspeed Mach Indicator

![mach](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_mach.jpg)

Indicated airspeed and Mach number display.

| No. | Control/Indicator                | Function                                                                                                              |
| --- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Airspeed dial                    | Shows indicated airspeed on three scales, two for indicated airspeed and one moving for Mach number.                  |
| 2   | Indicated airspeed scale (outer) | Used to indicate indicated airspeed up to 200 knots.                                                                  |
| 3   | Indicated airspeed scale (inner) | Used to indicate indicated airspeed from 200 knots to 850 knots. Covered by the airspeed dial until relevant.         |
| 4   | Mach number scale                | Moving scale used to indicate Mach number. Moved to show the correct Mach number relative to indicated airspeed.      |
| 5   | Indicated airspeed index pointer | Can be set to the desired indicated airspeed.                                                                         |
| 6   | Mach number index pointer        | Can be set to the desired Mach number. Not visible in image.                                                          |
| 7   | Safe Mach number index pointer   | Shows safe Mach number calculated by the CADC. Not visible in the image.                                              |
| 8   | Index knob                       | Knob with a pull-out and push-in position. One sets the indexer for indicated airspeed and the other for Mach number. |

## Standby Attitude Indicator

![standby attitude](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_standbyattitude.jpg)

Standalone standby attitude indicator.

An OFF flag is visible on the left side when caged or when un-powered.

The knob below and to the right of the indicator cages/un-cages the indicator
and allows trim to correct pitch. In the pulled-out position, the indicator is
caged. When pushed in, un-cages the indicator and allows pitch trim by turning
the knob.

## UHF Remote Indicator

![back remote](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_backremote.jpg)

Remote indicator displaying set frequency or channel on UHF 1 (AN/ARC-159).
Displays a readout of the frequency or channel set for the UHF 1 radio.

The TEST button initiates a test for the indicator, no fault results in a
readout of 888.888.

The DIM knob controls display brightness.
