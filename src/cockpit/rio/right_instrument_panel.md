# Right Instrument Panel

## Clock

![clock](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_clock.jpg)

Mechanical wind-up clock.

The wind/set knob (<num>1</num>) is located on the lower left corner.

- Rotate clockwise to wind the clock.
- Pull out and rotate to set the hour and minute hands.

The elapsed-time control (<num>2</num>) is located on the upper right corner and is used to start,
stop, and reset the 1-hour elapsed time counter.

## ALR-67 Indicator

![alr-67](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_alr-67.jpg)

Displays radar emitters detected by the ALR-67 radar warning receiver.

### Threat Display Bands

- Non-lethal band (<num>2</num>) - Displays emitters not considered an immediate threat due to range
  or lack of weapon capability.
- Lethal band (<num>3</num>) - Displays emitters capable of engaging own aircraft but not currently
  doing so.
- Critical band (<num>4</num>) - Displays direct threats to own aircraft. Systems capable of
  engaging own aircraft and showing current intent of doing so.

### System Status Circle

The system status circle (<num>1</num>) is divided into three areas.

**Area I (upper left quadrant)** displays threat prioritization symbols:

- N - Normal.
- I - AI, Airborne interceptors prioritized.
- A - AAA, Anti-air artillery prioritized.
- U - Unknown emitters prioritized.
- F - Friendly emitters displayed in addition to threats.

**Area II (upper right quadrant)** indicates limited mode status.

- (Blank) - Limited mode not selected.
- L - Limited mode selected. Only the six highest-priority threats are shown.

**Area III (lower half)** displays system status and offset information:

- (Blank) - Normal operation.
- B - BIT failure.
- T - Thermal overload.
- O - Offset display selected. Threats will be separated to allow readout of overlapping symbols.
  Bearing accuracy degraded for displaced threats.

### Intensity Control Knob

The INT knob (<num>5</num>) adjusts display brightness.

## Fuel Quantity Totalizer

![fuel](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_fuel.jpg)

The fuel quantity totalizer (<num>1</num>) displays total fuel quantity in all aircraft tanks.

## Threat Advisory and Master Caution Lights

![threat master](../../img/cockpit_detail_rio_threatmaster.jpg)

Master caution light and ECM/IFF advisory and warning indications.

The MASTER CAUTION light and reset button flashes to indicate a status change on the RIO
caution/advisory panel.

Press to acknowledge and extinguish the light until the next event.
