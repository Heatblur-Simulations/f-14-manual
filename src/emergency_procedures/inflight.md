## Engine Airstart

The F110-GE-400 engines can be airstarted one-by-one or simultaneously.  
Three restart methods are available:

- **Spooldown**
- **Cross-Bleed**
- **Windmill**

All attempts should be made in the engine mode selected by the AFTC (normally PRI, or SEC if PRI
fails).

## Spooldown Airstart

Spooldown airstart should be attempted immediately after engine loss, before significant spooldown
occurs.

- May take up to **10 seconds** for RPM increase and **90 seconds** to reach commanded RPM.
- If PRI fails, retry in SEC.

## Cross-Bleed Airstart

- Spooldown failed
- One engine is already running
- Target engine is near windmill RPM

## Windmill Airstart

Used when:

- Airspeed ≥ 450 KIAS
- Altitude permits sufficient airflow through engine
