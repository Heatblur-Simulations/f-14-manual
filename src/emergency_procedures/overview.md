# Emergency Procedures

## Engine Air-start

The F110-GE-400 engines can be air-started one-by-one or simultaneously.  
Three restart methods are available:

- **Spool-down**
- **Cross-Bleed**
- **Windmill**

All attempts should be made in the engine mode selected by the AFTC (normally
PRI, or SEC if PRI fails).

### Spool-down Air-start

Spool-down air-start should be attempted immediately after engine loss, before
significant spool-down occurs.

- May take up to **10 seconds** for RPM increase and **90 seconds** to reach
  commanded RPM.
- If PRI fails, retry in SEC.

#### Spool-down Air-start Checklist

| Step | Item                    | Action                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Throttle                | IDLE or above                                |
| 2    | If no relight: Throttle | OFF then IDLE                                |
| 3    | ENG MODE SELECT switch  | SEC                                          |
| 4    | Throttle                | If no start after mode switch: OFF then IDLE |
| 5    | After successful start  | Set ENG MODE SELECT to PRI if possible       |

### Cross-Bleed Air-start

Use if:

- Spool-down failed
- One engine is already running
- Target engine is near windmill RPM

#### Cross-Bleed Air-start Checklist

| Step | Item                    | Action                       |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | Non-running throttle    | OFF                          |
| 2    | FUEL SHUT OFF handle    | Verify handle IN             |
| 3    | Running engine throttle | Minimum 80% RPM              |
| 4    | BACK UP IGNITION switch | ON                           |
| 5    | ENG CRANK switch        | Set to non-running engine    |
| 6    | Non-running throttle    | IDLE immediately after CRANK |
| 7    | If no start: Throttle   | OFF then IDLE                |
| 8    | ENG MODE SELECT switch  | SEC                          |
| 9    | Throttle                | OFF then IDLE                |
| 10   | After successful start  | BACK UP IGNITION: OFF        |
| 11   | ENG MODE SELECT switch  | PRI if possible              |

### Windmill Air-start

Used when:

- Airspeed ≥ 450 KIAS
- Altitude permits sufficient airflow through engine

#### Windmill Air-start Checklist

| Step | Item                    | Action                |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Airspeed                | At or above 450 KIAS  |
| 2    | Throttle                | IDLE or above         |
| 3    | BACK UP IGNITION switch | ON                    |
| 4    | If no relight: Throttle | OFF then IDLE         |
| 5    | ENG MODE SELECT switch  | SEC                   |
| 6    | Throttle                | OFF then IDLE         |
| 7    | After successful start  | BACK UP IGNITION: OFF |
| 8    | ENG MODE SELECT switch  | PRI if possible       |
