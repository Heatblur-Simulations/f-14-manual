# Historical Background

> 🚧 TODO: Rewrite to be possibly more in depth like the F-4 manual as well as splitting up into

## Origins

The F-14 Tomcat traces its origins back to the 1950s, when the U.S. Navy identified the need for a
carrier-based, long-range interceptor to fulfill the Fleet Air Defence role. This aircraft would
require an advanced radar system and long-range air-to-air missiles, exceeding the capabilities of
the F-4 Phantom.

Under Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, the Navy was directed to join the Tactical Fighter
Experimental (TFX) program in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force. The Navy resisted this move, and
the resulting General Dynamics F-111B fell short of the Navy’s expectations.

Grumman, originally a subcontractor on the F-111B, was awarded a contract to develop a new aircraft
better suited to the Navy’s needs. This project retained key systems from the F-111B—most notably
the AN/AWG-9 radar and AIM-54 Phoenix missile—and eventually became the F-14 Tomcat.

The F-14 first flew on December 21, 1970, and entered service on September 22, 1974. The "Tomcat"
name followed Grumman’s feline naming tradition and referenced Vice Admiral Thomas F. Connolly, an
advocate for the aircraft.

## Service Life Upgrades

- **F-14A** was the original model, equipped with Pratt & Whitney TF30 engines and an IRST system in
  the chinpod. These engines were underpowered and unreliable, later replaced by the General
  Electric F110-GE-400 in the **F-14A+**, which became the **F-14B**.
- The IRST system was replaced early in development by the **TCS (Television Camera Set)**, allowing
  for long-range visual ID of radar targets.
- Progressive upgrades included:
  - PTID/PMDIG programmable cockpit displays
  - INS system enhancements
  - Digital Flight Control System (DFCS)
  - Upgraded RWR systems

The **TARPS** (Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System) was later added for photographic
reconnaissance capability.

## Ground Attack Role

In the 1990s, as the air threat declined and conflicts like Desert Storm arose, the Navy
reconsidered the F-14’s ground attack capabilities.

Although designed to carry air-to-ground munitions, cost and risk had initially ruled out this role.
Renewed interest led to the integration of the **LANTIRN targeting pod**, enabling precision
laser-guided bomb delivery by the RIO.

Later upgrades also allowed the F-14 to carry **GPS-guided JDAMs**. Most LANTIRN-equipped aircraft
also featured the upgraded PTID display for improved integration.

## F-14D

The **F-14D**, introduced in the 1990s, featured:

- GE F110-GE-400 engines (same as F-14B)
- DFCS system (retrofitted to earlier variants)
- AN/APG-71 radar (successor to AN/AWG-9)
- Integrated TCS/IRST in a new chinpod
- Avionics suite overhaul

---

## End of Service

The F-14 was ultimately retired due to:

- Aging airframes
- High maintenance costs
- A diminishing need for Fleet Air Defence post–Cold War

The Tomcat was officially retired by the U.S. Navy on **September 22, 2006**, at NAS Oceana.

## Iran

Iran was the only other operator of the F-14. The Shah of Iran ordered 80 F-14As for the Imperial
Iranian Air Force. Following the 1979 revolution, the **Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF)**
inherited the fleet.

Sanctions cut off access to spare parts, forcing Iran to:

- Cannibalize aircraft
- Use black market sources
- Possibly develop indigenous parts

Despite limitations, Iran successfully used the F-14 during the Iran–Iraq War, claiming significant
air-to-air victories. As of today, Iran remains the only operator of the F-14, flying early F-14A
models with TF30 engines and no TCS or IRST.

## AIM-54 Phoenix

Originally developed for the F-111B, the **AIM-54 Phoenix** missile was adopted for the F-14. Key
features:

- Long-range engagement of bombers and cruise missiles
- Midcourse guidance via AN/AWG-9 radar, terminal phase via onboard active radar seeker
- Simultaneous engagement of up to six targets

Variants:

- **AIM-54A**: Original version with Mk 47 rocket motor
- **AIM-54C**: Improved seeker and lower smoke motor
