<p><img src="../img/general_tcs_tcs.jpg" alt="TCS" /> <em>U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s Mate
Airman Justin S. Osborne. (030418-N-0382O-591)</em></p>
<p>The television camera set, or TCS, was constructed as a replacement for the IRST
which was present in the first F-14As produced. When the IRST was found to have
insufficient capability it was decided to replace it with the TCS giving the
F-14 a long range visual identification capability.</p>
<p>The TCS is located underneath and behind the radar radome, just in front of the
nose gear well. It contains an aircraft stabilized high resolution (for its
time) closed circuit television camera. The sensor has two fields of view (FOV),
narrow (NFOV) which is 0.44° or 10X magnification and wide (WFOV) which is 1.42°
or 4X magnification. The gimbal limits are +/- 15° except upwards which is
limited to +11° and the TCS is capable of independent contrast lock or being
slaved to the AN/AWG-9 radar.</p>
<p>The TCS is controlled by the RIO using the sensor control panel, DDD, TID and
the HCU. Video from the sensor can be displayed on the TID and the VDI in the
front seat. Also, the video can be recorded using the airborne video tape
recorder for later review. (Not currently implemented in DCS.)</p>
<h2 id="controls"><a class="header" href="#controls">Controls</a></h2>
<p>The controls for the TCS are located in the RIO cockpit at the sensor control
panel, the DDD and the HCU/TID. The pilot display control panel contains a
switch allowing display of TCS video on the VDI.</p>
<h3 id="sensor-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#sensor-control-panel">Sensor Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="../img/scp.jpg" alt="Sensor Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The controls on the sensor control panel for the TCS are; the TCS trim knobs,
the SLAVE switch, the field of view, FOV, switch and the acquire, ACQ, switch.</p>
<p>The <strong>TCS TRIM</strong> knobs controls TCS sensor line of sight, LOS, calibration
relative the AN/AWG-9 radar LOS. If needed these can be used to trim the TCS so
that the two sensors LOS correlate. They have a ±2° range of motion and the
easiest way to check and calibrate the TCS is to lock up a friendly target in
STT and adjust the knobs until the TCS LOS is correctly aimed at the locked
target.</p>
<p>The <strong>SLAVE</strong> switch controls which sensor is controlled by the other. If set to
<strong>RDR</strong> the radar is slaved to the TCS as long as an optical track exists. If
set to <strong>INDEP</strong> each sensor operates independently of the other. And if set to
<strong>TCS</strong> the TCS is slaved to radar LOS as long as an STT track exists.</p>
<p>The <strong>FOV</strong>, field of view switch controls what FOV is used in the TCS. <strong>WIDE</strong>
sets the 1.42°, 4X magnification FOV and <strong>NAR</strong> sets the narrow 0.44°, 10X
magnification FOV.</p>
<p>Lastly the <strong>ACQ</strong>, acquire switch controls the acquisition mode in use in the
TCS. <strong>AUTO SRCH</strong> enables an automatic acquisition mode with a search pattern,
enabling acquisition of the closest target even if outside current FOV. <strong>MAN</strong>
selects purely manual acquisition with the HCU where the target needs to be
pointed at directly. <strong>AUTO</strong> sets an automatic acquisition mode without a
search pattern making the TCS snap to a target as long as it’s inside the TCS
FOV.</p>
<h4 id="tcs-controls"><a class="header" href="#tcs-controls">TCS Controls</a></h4>
<p>The <strong>TCS TRIM</strong> knobs controls TCS calibration in azimuth (AZ) and elevation
(EL). This is used to calibrate the TCS line of sight to be equal to the radar
line of sight. Normally this is done by locking a target in STT, setting slave
to TCS and then fine-tuning the calibration knobs until the TCS looks directly
at the locked target.</p>
<p>The last two switches controlling the TCS are the ACQ (acquisition) and FOV
(field of view) switches. The <strong>ACQ</strong> switch controls how the TCS locks onto
targets. AUTO SRCH means the TCS will move by itself in a limited search pattern
trying to find a target. MAN (manual) means the TCS only locks onto targets if
commanded to by the HCU in TCS mode and AUTO means the TCS automatically tries
to lock onto targets entering its field of view. The <strong>FOV</strong> switch sets whether
the WIDE or NAR (narrow) field of view is used by the TCS.</p>
<h3 id="ddd"><a class="header" href="#ddd">DDD</a></h3>
<p><img src="../img/general_tcs_tcsddd.jpg" alt="DDD" /></p>
<p>The DDD contains two indicators pertaining to the TCS.</p>
<p>The <strong>DDD EL</strong> meter shows current elevation of the TCS sensor LOS as long as
the IR/TV mode is selected on the HCU.</p>
<p>The <strong>IROT</strong> light indicates the presence of a TCS track. The IROT acronym is
inherited from the IRST which the TCS replaced.</p>
<h3 id="hcutid"><a class="header" href="#hcutid">HCU/TID</a></h3>
<p><img src="../img/general_tcs_hcu.jpg" alt="HCU/TID" /></p>
<p>The HCU contains the power switch and indicator for the TCS as well as a button
enabling selection for using the HCU to control the TCS while the TID itself has
a control knob enabling display of the TCS video on the TID as well as a
brightness and contrast control for the video on the TID.</p>
<p>The <strong>IR/TV power</strong> switch is located on the top left corner on the HCU panel
and controls power to the TCS. <strong>OFF</strong> disables all power to the TCS. <strong>STBY</strong>
enables power to the cooling fans and heaters in the TCS. <strong>IR/TV</strong> supplies
power to all systems in the TCS, allow 1-2 minutes for the TCS to spin up and
deliver video. TCS symbology on the TID on the other hand will be available
directly. There is also no need to select the STBY position first, setting the
switch to IR/TV directly works fine.</p>
<p>The indication light next to the power switch indicates a TCS over temperature
condition is lit. If present the TCS should be powered off to prevent damage to
the system.</p>
<p>The <strong>IR/TV</strong> button next to the HCU stick enables HCU stick control of the TCS
sensor, half-action to manually control sensor LOS and full-action to command
target acquisition.</p>
<p>On the TID display control the <strong>TID MODE</strong> switch set to <strong>TV</strong> enables display
of the TCS video on the TID. Note that this disables the TID repeat on the HSD.</p>
<p>Finally the <strong>CONTRAST</strong> and <strong>BRIGHTNESS</strong> knobs on the upper part of the TID
can be used to control the TCS video shown on the TID.</p>
<h2 id="symbology"><a class="header" href="#symbology">Symbology</a></h2>
<p><img src="../img/general_tcs_symbology.jpg" alt="Symbology" /></p>
<p>On the TID in non TV mode a TCS track is indicated by a 1.5” strobe at TCS LOS
azimuth with a hollow circle at the end.</p>
<p>The symbology on the video feed from the TCS has indicators for the FOV and two
crosshairs indicating TCS LOS relative own aircraft, <strong>GACH</strong>, and AN/AWG-9
radar LOS relative TCS LOS, <strong>RACH</strong>. Additionally the track window is indicated
by 4 small squares representing each corner of that window.</p>
<p>The field of view lines are shown when in the wide FOV indicating the size of
the area visible when switching to the narrow FOV. They consist of two parallel
lines together creating the sides of an imaginary box indicating the narrow FOV
size.</p>
<p>The gimbal angle crosshairs or <strong>GACH</strong>, which is a solid cross, indicate
deflection of the TCS LOS from the aircraft datum line, ADL. GACH crosshair in
center indicates TCS LOS along ADL and deflection towards the edges indicate
deflection towards the gimbal limits with the video edges being maximum
deflection.</p>
<p><strong>RACH</strong> or radar angle crosshairs, a dashed crosshair, indicate radar antenna
LOS when inside the current TCS FOV. When the sensors are slaved to one another
RACH and GACH will coincide creating a single solid crosshair.</p>
<p>The track window indicates the area that the TCS contrast tracker is currently
locked on to if it has acquired a target. When not in an active track these
squares collapse into the center of the display being 2% of the screen width
when in manual mode and 5% when in an auto mode.</p>
<h2 id="tcs-operation"><a class="header" href="#tcs-operation">TCS Operation</a></h2>
<p>All acquisition modes of the TCS have in common that they can be controlled
using the HCU in IR/TV mode. Selection of the IR/TV button on the HCU enables
this mode and also sets the DDD EL meter (right indicator) to show current TCS
sensor LOS elevation. Half-action enables the HCU to directly control the LOS of
the TCS and full-action commands target acquisition using the selected
acquisition mode.</p>
<p>For manual, <strong>MAN</strong>, TCS acquisition mode this means that the HCU must be used
in half-action to position the tracking window indication over the target and
then selecting full-action. If successfully acquired the track window will then
expand to encompass the target and tracking will begin.</p>
<p>In automatic, <strong>AUTO</strong> acquisition mode half-action works the same but when
selecting full-action for acquisition the TCS will instead automatically try to
lock on to the target closest to the center in the current FOV. Automatic
search, <strong>AUTO SRCH</strong> mode further enhances this by enabling a search pattern
around the commanded FOV (by moving the sensor LOS) acquiring the first found
target.</p>
<p>When using the TCS slave to radar option the two auto modes will automatically
try to lock on to the STT target as soon as it exists and the TCS has been
slewed to that target, enabling a fully automatic track of a target locked in
STT. Additionally, as soon as a track is acquired from an STT lock the TCS will
compare its own LOS to the radar LOS to check if the correct target has been
locked, if the two LOS differ by more than a couple of degrees during a 3-second
window a new acquisition will be attempted. The manual mode will also slave to
radar LOS but will not lock on, instead just following the radar LOS.</p>
<p>To unlock a tracked target when not being slaved to radar, select half-action
and release.</p>
<p>For information about RDR slaved to TCS check the relevant AN/AWG-9 section.</p>
<h3 id="tcs-slave-radar-acquisition"><a class="header" href="#tcs-slave-radar-acquisition">TCS Slave Radar Acquisition</a></h3>
<p>The TCS can be used to track a target in angle while still using the radar for
range and rate. When selecting the radar to be slaved to the TCS line of sight
via the sensor control panel (SLAVE in the RDR position) the radar will still be
active but pointing in the direction of the TCS line of sight while the TCS has
an active track instead of scanning.</p>
<p>From this state it is possible to command half-action and then position the
acquisition gates at the target video and then command full-action. This will
result in either pulse doppler slaved or pulse slaved mode depending on previous
radar mode. It is also possible to switch using the P STT and PD STT button on
the DDD panel.</p>
<p>The resulting sub-mode entered is equivalent to an STT mode where the TCS is
instead used to track the target's angle rather than the radar itself. The radar
is still used to track range and rate, on the DDD the IROT lights instead of the
ANT ROT, IROT relating to IR tracking which has been replaced by the TCS in the
modeled F-14 versions.</p>
<p>This mode can be used to guide missiles, active and CW modes if in pulse and in
PD if in pulse doppler. If the SLAVE switch is set to INDEP from this mode the
system reverts to true pulse STT or pulse doppler STT depending on current mode.</p>
