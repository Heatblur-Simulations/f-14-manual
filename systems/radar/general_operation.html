<p>Detection-range approximation for a 5m²-target.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pulse-mode"><a class="header" href="#pulse-mode">Pulse Mode</a></h2>
<p>In the pulse mode of operation the AN/AWG-9 does not use pulse doppler filtering which means that it
can be used to detect targets at all aspects and also be used for rudimentary ground mapping. On the
pro side this means that the radar in this mode cannot be notched as it does not need to have a
relative speed to register the target. The downside however is that the radar does not have an easy
way of differentiate between unwanted ground reflections and real targets meaning that aircraft can
hide in the ground clutter near the ground. Because of this and the increased difficulty from trying
to differentiate real targets from the general background noise without doppler filtering means that
the range in the pulse modes are less than in the pulse doppler modes.</p>
<p>The radar has two pulse modes, pulse search and pulse single target track (P-STT).</p>
<h3 id="pulse-search-pulse-srch"><a class="header" href="#pulse-search-pulse-srch">Pulse Search (PULSE SRCH)</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/PSEARCH.png" alt="Pulse Search" /></p>
<p>Pulse search is used to search for and find airborne targets at range.</p>
<p>It is possible to use this radar mode as a basic ground mapper as well which can be useful for
navigation and navigational fixes and can also be used in a pinch to detect larger surface targets
like ships. Keep in mind though that the radar is not built with this as its main function and that
a real air-to-ground radar will outperform it handily.</p>
<p>In this mode the radar cannot by itself differentiate targets and generate tracks meaning that the
WCS will not generate track files and display anything on the TID. This also means that pulse search
is not capable of guiding missiles.</p>
<p>The DDD in this mode will display a radar image indicating the azimuth and range of targets at
selected scale and it is possible to transition to P STT using the RDR mode with the HCU stick. It
is possible to select ground or aircraft stabilized modes of operation using the STAB switch on the
sensor control panel.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-single-target-track-p-stt"><a class="header" href="#pulse-single-target-track-p-stt">Pulse Single Target Track (P-STT)</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/PSTT.png" alt="Pulse STT" /></p>
<p>Pulse STT is used to track a single target, like pulse search mode it is not susceptible to notching
but it is to ground clutter. The fact that the STT modes use gates to track the target, in this case
range gates, means that it is less susceptible to ground clutter but a target close enough to the
ground that the ground return enters the range gates would be likely to shake the lock.</p>
<p>As it is only in the pulse doppler modes that the missile guidance commands can be sent pulse STT is
limited to launching AIM-7s in CW mode and AIM-54s in active launch mode limiting their ranges. At
short ranges, ACM ranges, it is possible to use the ASPECT switch to set what aspect of the target
to track, this is just to counter different types of countermeasures. As an example, if set to NOSE
the radar will be less susceptible to chaff as the radar weights its track towards the targets
leading edge (nose) away from the chaff being launched behind the target.</p>
<p>A successful track is indicated by the ANT TRK and RDROT indicator lights on the DDD, meaning that
the antenna is tracking the target and that the target is within the range gates. If the target is
jamming with sufficient strength, negating a range track, the radar will transition to a jam angle
track instead, indicated by the JAT indicator light on the DDD illuminating instead of the RDROT.
When range tracking is again possible at closer ranges the radar will transition to that instead.</p>
<p>The DDD in this mode will be similar to the pulse search mode but the antenna will be locked onto
the target and not scan. Additionally the DDD will show the range gates around the target, a closing
rate symbol at the right scale and applicable attack symbology if a valid missile is selected.</p>
<h2 id="pulse-doppler-mode"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-mode">Pulse Doppler Mode</a></h2>
<p>In pulse doppler mode the AN/AWG-9 uses doppler filters to filter out unwanted returns, enhancing
target detection and thus increasing detection range. The pros of this mode being that, as said,
targets can be detected at greater ranges, ground returns mostly eliminated and missile guidance
commands be sent to AIM-7 and AIM-54 missiles. The AIM-54 both in TWS and STT and the AIM-7 in STT
only. The biggest con of this mode being that it is susceptible to notching as a target returning
zero relative speed will be filtered out.</p>
<p>The pulse doppler modes of the AN/AWG-9 are, pulse doppler search, range while search, track while
scan and pulse doppler STT. The three search modes have a common DDD display, the main difference
being that pulse doppler search has a slightly better range as the other two modes need to process
FM-ranging to enable range indication of tracked targets.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-search-modes"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-search-modes">Pulse Doppler Search Modes</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/PDSEARCH.png" alt="Pulse Doppler Search" /></p>
<p>The DDD in the pulse doppler search modes displays returns at azimuth versus rate (closing speed)
meaning that by reading only the DDD the RIO can only discern target closing speed and azimuth. The
display indicates observed closure rate vs the ground (with own airspeed subtracted) as opposed to
relative closure rate. While this means that a target directly ahead, moving directly towards the
radar, will show true target airspeed this speed varies with target aspect and radar antenna
azimuth. This reason for this is that the radar itself only reads relative airspeed which is then
modified by subtracting own airspeed for display on the DDD.</p>
<p>At the bottom edge of the DDD the AGC-trace is displayed indicating radar return intensity enabling
the RIO to discern jamming targets by their return strength. The jamming targets are shown as
jamming strobes on the TID if they exceed the set jamming threshold (set by the JAM/JET knob on the
DDD).</p>
<p>The scale shown on the DDD (what rate region is shown) can be set by the Vc switch on the DDD panel.
X-4 sets the scale to 800 knots opening to 4 000 knots closing, NORM sets the scale to 200 knots
opening to 1 000 knots closing and VID sets the scale to 50 knots opening to 250 knots closing. The
operating range of the doppler filters can also be configured by the ASPECT switch on the same
panel, NOSE sets 600 knots opening to 1 800 knots closing, BEAM sets 1200 knots closing to 1200
knots opening and TAIL sets 1 800 knots opening to 600 knots closing. This allows the RIO to
optimize the doppler filters for a known target closing speed and this affects the whole radar
processing unlike the Vc switch which only affects the DDD.</p>
<p>Because of the way the radar operates the doppler filters it will have two blind ranges. The main
lobe clutter (MLC) region which contains most of the ground returns, including those returning with
zero groundspeed and is 266 knots wide, centered around own aircraft groundspeed (133 knots slower
and 133 knots faster). This is the reason that the radar can be notched as a target with the same
relative groundspeed as the ground will also be filtered out. This is however only true for
look-down conditions as when the radar antenna looks up into the sky this filter isn’t necessary and
can be turned off. If the MLC switch on the DDD panel is in AUTO the radar will automatically turn
off the MLC filter if looking more than 3 degrees above the horizon. It can also be turned off
manually by the RIO but if the antenna looks down this can make the displays unusable in RWS and TWS
as all of the ground returns will be sent to the computer for tracking. In whichever case, with the
MLC filter off, the target cannot notch the AN/AWG-9 if it is above the radar.</p>
<p>The second filter, and second blind spot, of the radar is the zero doppler filter. This blind area
is centered around a closure rate of negative own groundspeed, meaning a target moving away from own
aircraft at the same speed as own aircraft. This blind area is a hardware limitation as it is a
doppler radar mode it cannot detect targets without a doppler shift. The resulting blind area is 200
knots wide, meaning that a chased target moving at a speed of within 100 knots (+/-) of own
groundspeed will be invisible to the radar. This means that when chasing a fleeing target it may
very well be necessary to use the pulse modes instead.</p>
<p>Both filters vary with azimuth as own airspeed relative to target varies with aspect. Relative
airspeed from a target at 45° will be less than a target at 0° as own speed vector will be pointing
away from it slightly. This is the reason for the mainlobe clutter trace presenting a curve on the
DDD as the observed speed of the returning ground returns will vary with azimuth.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pd.png" alt="PD" /></p>
<p>Target groundspeed 900 knots, own airspeed 1200 knots. See table below for details, line of sight
rate is the sum of target and own aircraft relative rate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Position 4 has the target in a flanking or “notching” position making it disappear
inside the MLC filter or MLC ground return. In a look-up situation with the MLC filter disabled
the target would still be visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, all pulse doppler search modes use ground stabilization exclusively and thus the STAB
switch is inoperative.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-search-pd-srch"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-search-pd-srch">Pulse Doppler Search (PD SRCH)</a></h3>
<p>The pulse doppler search mode is used mainly as a kind of early warning mode. It is the search mode
with the greatest detection range but it can display no range to the RIO, only closure rate. For
this reason, the TID can display no track information.</p>
<h3 id="range-while-search-rws"><a class="header" href="#range-while-search-rws">Range While Search (RWS)</a></h3>
<p>In range while search a frequency measuring ranging mode is added (FM ranging) to allow the radar to
measure range of tracked targets in addition to closure rate. This additional processing does
however mean that the effective range of the radar is somewhat lesser. The display on the DDD is the
same as in pulse doppler search, the TID however also shows tracks in this mode showing the targets
as tracks momentarily as they’re scanned and displaying their position and altitude. The targets are
shown for a maximum of two seconds or until the antenna again scans the same bar at the same azimuth
at which time it is removed unless detected again. Maximum number of concurrently shown tracks
are 48.</p>
<h3 id="track-while-scan-tws"><a class="header" href="#track-while-scan-tws">Track While Scan (TWS)</a></h3>
<p>The track while scan mode uses the same FM ranging as RWS with the same reduction in range compared
to pulse doppler search and the DDD display is also the same. The main difference that the computer
establishes track files and tracks up to 24 targets concurrently of which 18 can be shown on the TID
at any given time.</p>
<p>As the computer routine calculating these tracks need a set track refresh time of 2 seconds this
limits available azimuth scan area and bar settings to either 20° 4 bars or 40° 2 bars. When
entering TWS the computer automatically selects the ±20° 4 bar scan disregarding the RIO set scan
volumes unless those are set to ±40° 2 bars in which case that is used instead.</p>
<p>The TWS mode is also the only mode enabling guidance of the AIM-54 at multiple targets (up to six),
and as soon as engagable targets are detected the computer starts assigning them a missile priority
number according to optimal missile firing sequence.</p>
<p>The TWS has two submodes available, TWS Auto (TWS AUTO) and TWS Manual (TWS MAN), which one is used
is selected by the RIO with the corresponding button on the DDD panel. What differs between the two
is that in TWS auto the computer takes control of used scan volume and scan pattern azimuth and
elevation as soon as target tracks are present. The WCS computer automatically tries to optimise the
scan volume and direction so that tracking of the prioritized targets is maximised. If not selected
before launch the WCS overrides as soon as the first AIM-54 is launched and selects TWS Auto.</p>
<p>In TWS the pilot is guided to the computed centroid of the tracked targets via the navigational cues
and this centroid is also displayed on the TID as a small x-shaped cross.</p>
<p>For additional information about TWS symbology and missile guidance see TWS and TID Symbology.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-single-target-track-pd-stt"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-single-target-track-pd-stt">Pulse Doppler Single Target Track (PD-STT)</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/PDSTT.png" alt="Pulse Doppler STT" /></p>
<p>The pulse doppler STT works and looks much like the pulse STT mode. It does however have the same
advantages and disadvantages compared to pulse STT as the other pulse doppler modes compared to the
pulse modes. This means that while much better at tracking a target close to the ground it is
however vulnerable to notching.</p>
<p>The DDD display for pulse doppler STT looks like pulse STT display except that the target return and
antenna azimuth display is moved to the left side of the screen and a generated synthetic target
marker is displayed at the correct azimuth instead. This is so that the targets range can be
displayed by the synthetic target unlike the other pulse doppler modes which only shows closure
rate. The other symbology on the DDD in this mode are the same as in pulse STT.</p>
<p>Unlike in pulse STT however the AN/AWG-9 can send missile guidance commands in pulse doppler STT
enabling launch of AIM-7 and AIM-54 in pulse doppler mode. This is the mode with the greatest launch
ranges for those missiles with the disadvantage, in the case of the AIM-54, of only being able to
engage one target at a time.</p>
<h2 id="hcu-stick-in-radar-mode"><a class="header" href="#hcu-stick-in-radar-mode">HCU Stick in Radar Mode</a></h2>
<p>When using the AN/AWG-9 radar in the different search modes it’s possible to manually use the HCU
stick with radar mode selected to select a target on the DDD for STT lock.</p>
<p>Pressing the HCU trigger to half-action while in radar mode displays the acquisition gates on the
DDD and enables the supersearch mode in the radar. In supersearch mode the antenna does a ±10°
search pattern at the selected amount of bars around the acquisition gates.</p>
<p>The acquisition gates can then be steered over the detected position of the target with the HCU,
left/right used to steer azimuth and up/down used to steer range or rate depending on if pulse or
pulse doppler is used. The antenna elevation is then fine-tuned using the elevation vernier on the
HCU until the target return is visible within the acquisition gates. At that time the RIO can then
select full-action on the HCU trigger, commanding the radar to attempt a lockon at the commanded
azimuth, range/rate and elevation.</p>
<p>If successfully executed the radar then transitions into the respective STT mode and the correct
indicators on the DDD illuminates. Pulse STT is used if transitioning from pulse search and pulse
doppler STT if transitioning from any of the pulse doppler search modes.</p>
<h2 id="transitional-modes"><a class="header" href="#transitional-modes">Transitional Modes</a></h2>
<p>The transitional modes are the ones used to transition into the single target tracks from the search
modes, ACM modes, via TCS or between the two STT modes.</p>
<h3 id="transition-between-the-two-stt-modes"><a class="header" href="#transition-between-the-two-stt-modes">Transition Between the Two STT Modes</a></h3>
<p>If necessary it is possible to transition between pulse STT and pulse doppler STT by pressing the
corresponding button. If the transition fails the radar reverts to the respective search mode of the
commanded STT mode (pulse search if pulse STT was selected and vice versa).</p>
<h3 id="transition-back-to-search"><a class="header" href="#transition-back-to-search">Transition Back to Search</a></h3>
<p>If the RIO wishes to transition back to a search mode he commands half-action and releases it
causing the radar to return to pulse search if in pulse STT and pulse doppler search if in pulse
doppler STT.</p>
<p>If the radar loses target lock in STT and cannot reacquire it reverts to the respective search mode
as when the RIO transitions manually via half-action.</p>
<p>VSL and MRL can also be reset and returned to search the same way but PLM being prioritized means
that the only way to deselect PLM is either target lockon and transition to pulse STT or the pilot
selecting the PLM button again telling the radar to return to pulse search.</p>
<h2 id="tws-stt-acquisition"><a class="header" href="#tws-stt-acquisition">TWS STT Acquisition</a></h2>
<p>In TWS it is possible to attempt an STT lockon by hooking a track on the TID and then selecting
either pulse STT or pulse doppler STT on the DDD panel. The WCS computer then commands the antenna
in supersearch to the hooked tracks azimuth, range/rate and elevation and attempts a lockon if a
target is detected.</p>
<p>Unlike in a manual HCU acquisition this process is completely automated but its success rate is also
less than a manual transition.</p>
